# _brand-us.yml — United States State Overrides
# ================================================
# This file contains US-specific overrides for _brand.yml.
# It covers state helplines, legal ages, and state-specific
# configuration. Unlike Canada, most US states share a
# national helpline (NCPG) rather than operating their own.
#
# Usage:
#   Merge these values into your _brand.yml when deploying
#   {{PROGRAM_NAME}} in US states. Each state may have
#   different legal ages, permitted products, and regulatory
#   requirements.
#
# See: jurisdictions/united-states/README.md for the full US overview
