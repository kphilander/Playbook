## Nevada's principles-based standard

### Regulation 5.011(4)

Nevada's advertising regulation is deliberately **principles-based** rather than prescriptive:

> All advertising and marketing materials used by a licensee must conform to prevailing community standards of decency, dignity, good taste, honesty, and inoffensiveness.

This contrasts significantly with jurisdictions like British Columbia, which layer provincial rules, BCLC standards, and the Canadian Gambling Advertising Code into a detailed prescriptive framework. Nevada gives operators more flexibility — and more responsibility — to exercise judgment.

### Five principles explained

| Principle | What it means in practice | {{PROGRAM_NAME}} alignment |
|---|---|---|
| **Decency** | No sexually explicit content; no content that exploits or degrades | {{PROGRAM_NAME}}'s brand voice is confident and witty, never crude or exploitative |
| **Dignity** | Gambling presented as entertainment, not desperation; players treated with respect | Core {{PROGRAM_NAME}} principle — "player" not "gambler," entertainment literacy |
| **Good taste** | No gratuitous violence, shock value, or content designed primarily to offend | {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content is informational and engaging, never provocative for its own sake |
| **Honesty** | All claims factual; odds/probabilities accurate; no misleading impressions | {{PROGRAM_NAME}}'s "Open" pillar is built on transparency and accurate information |
| **Inoffensiveness** | No content that would offend a reasonable person; no targeting vulnerable populations | {{PROGRAM_NAME}}'s two-tier system inherently respects audience sensitivity |

### How NGCB enforces

- NGCB's **Enforcement Division** reviews advertising complaints and may initiate investigations
- Enforcement is **reactive** (complaint-driven) more than proactive, but NGCB can and does take action
- Penalties range from warnings to fines to licence conditions to revocation (severe cases)
- NGCB evaluates against "prevailing community standards" — this is subjective and may shift over time
- There is no pre-approval requirement — operators self-certify compliance

### Comparison with other jurisdictions

| Area | Nevada | BC | UK (UKGC/ASA) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Approach** | Principles-based | Prescriptive (multi-layer) | Highly prescriptive (CAP/BCAP codes) |
| **Mandatory statement** | None | "Know your limit, play within it." | "When the fun stops, stop." (BeGambleAware) |
| **Pre-approval** | No | No (but BCLC reviews) | No (but ASA adjudicates complaints) |
| **Enforcement** | Complaint-driven | Licence conditions | ASA rulings + UKGC licence conditions |
| **Specificity** | Five broad principles | Itemized rules + national code | Detailed CAP/BCAP codes (~100 rules) |

---

## AGA Responsible Gaming Code

The **American Gaming Association (AGA)** publishes a voluntary **Responsible Marketing Code for Sports Wagering** and general advertising principles. While not law in Nevada, most major operators are AGA members and follow these standards. NGCB references AGA standards when evaluating advertising practices.

### Key advertising provisions

| Provision | Requirement | {{PROGRAM_NAME}} alignment |
|---|---|---|
| **No targeting minors** | Advertising must not target audiences under 21 or use themes, imagery, or language that primarily appeals to minors | {{PROGRAM_NAME}} targets adult players; no cartoon characters, child-oriented language, or youth media buys |
| **No misleading odds** | Must not misrepresent the likelihood of winning or suggest that skill guarantees outcomes in games of chance | {{PROGRAM_NAME}}'s "Open" pillar is built on honest odds presentation |
| **Responsible messaging** | All advertising should include a responsible gaming message and helpline reference | {{PROGRAM_NAME}} includes helpline in all collateral |
| **No excessive play** | Must not encourage excessive or irresponsible gambling | {{PROGRAM_NAME}} promotes informed play and limit-setting |
| **Self-exclusion respect** | Must not market to self-excluded individuals | Operator responsibility — {{PROGRAM_NAME}} supports by providing self-exclusion information |
| **Endorsements** | Celebrity and athlete endorsements must comply with FTC disclosure rules | Standard FTC compliance; {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content rarely uses endorsements |

### Sports betting-specific provisions

The AGA's **Responsible Marketing Code for Sports Wagering** adds:

| Provision | Details |
|---|---|
| **No active athlete endorsement** | Active professional athletes should not endorse sports wagering products |
| **No college student targeting** | Advertising must not specifically target college-age audiences in campus environments |
| **Odds accuracy** | Published odds must be accurate and current |
| **Promotional terms** | Bonus and promotional offers must include clear terms and conditions |
| **Frequency limits** | Voluntary limits on advertising frequency during live sports broadcasts |

### Online poker advertising

## Prohibited content

The following content is **prohibited** in Nevada gambling advertising. While Nevada's regulation is principles-based (not an itemized list), NGCB enforcement and AGA guidelines establish clear boundaries:

| Category | Prohibited content | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Minors** | Any depiction of minors gambling. Content, language, characters, or themes primarily appealing to persons under 21. Cartoon characters or mascots that appeal to children. | NRS 463.0129, Reg 5.011(4), AGA Code |
| **Misleading odds** | Claims suggesting guaranteed wins, "easy money," or that outcomes are predictable. Misrepresentation of odds, probabilities, or prize sizes. | Reg 5.011(4) ("honesty"), AGA Code |
| **Financial solution** | Portraying gambling as a way to pay bills, achieve financial security, or solve money problems. | Reg 5.011(4) ("dignity"), AGA Code |
| **Targeting self-excluded** | Any marketing directed at individuals on a property's self-exclusion list. | Reg 5.170 |
| **Indecent/offensive** | Sexually explicit, gratuitously violent, or content designed primarily to shock or offend. | Reg 5.011(4) ("decency," "good taste," "inoffensiveness") |
| **Exploitation** | Content that exploits vulnerable populations, trivializes problem gambling, or presents excessive play positively. | Reg 5.011(4) ("dignity"), AGA Code |
| **False endorsements** | Fabricated endorsements, undisclosed paid partnerships, or endorsements by persons under 21. | FTC guidelines, Reg 5.011(4) ("honesty") |

### What Nevada does NOT explicitly prohibit

Unlike more prescriptive jurisdictions, Nevada does not have explicit rules against:

| Area | Nevada status | Comparison |
|---|---|---|
| **Urgency language** | Not explicitly prohibited | BC/UK restrict "don't miss out," "limited time" in gambling contexts |
| **Alcohol pairing** | Not explicitly prohibited | BC restricts close association with alcohol in ads |
| **Skill language (poker)** | Permitted (poker involves skill) | Some jurisdictions restrict skill claims broadly |
| **Bonus prominence** | Not explicitly prohibited | BC limits bonus inducement as primary ad message |

However, all of these are still subject to the broad Reg 5.011(4) principles. Content that uses urgency language to encourage impulsive gambling could violate "dignity" or "good taste." {{PROGRAM_NAME}} recommends exercising judgment consistent with the brand's values regardless of what is technically permitted.

## Required disclosures

Nevada's required disclosures are less extensive than prescriptive jurisdictions. The following must appear in gambling advertising:

| Disclosure | Format | Requirement source |
|---|---|---|
| **21+** | "21+" or "Must be 21 or older to gamble" | NRS 463.0129 |
| **Helpline** | Gambling helpline number (1-800-GAMBLER / 1-800-MY-RESET / 1-800-522-4700) | Reg 5.170 (posting requirement); Reg 5A (interactive gaming advertising) |
| **Terms and conditions** | For any bonus, promotion, or offer | Reg 5A (interactive gaming); AGA Code (all) |
| **Geolocation** | "Must be physically located in Nevada" (interactive gaming only) | Reg 5A |
| **In-person registration** | Note that mobile sports accounts require in-person registration | Reg 5A |

### What Nevada does NOT require

| Disclosure | Required in Nevada? | Required in BC? |
|---|---|---|
| Mandatory verbatim statement | **No** | Yes ("Know your limit, play within it.") |
| Helpline in every ad | Recommended, not explicitly mandated for land-based | Yes (every ad) |
| Odds accuracy statement | Only if odds are referenced | Only if odds are referenced |
| Specific font size minimums | No Nevada-specific minimums | 14pt minimum for statement and helpline |
| Spoken statement in audio ads | No | Yes (mandatory statement must be spoken) |

### On-brand disclosure integration

{{PROGRAM_NAME}} treats disclosures as designed content, not fine print — even in Nevada where fewer are required:

**Typical approach** (disclosures as afterthought):
> *[main ad content]*
> *^Must be 21+. If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, call 1-800-GAMBLER.*

**{{PROGRAM_NAME}} approach** (disclosures as designed content):
> *[main ad content]*
>
> **21+ | Play on your terms.** Free, confidential support: **1-800-GAMBLER** | **1-800-MY-RESET**

| Floor sign (sign-2a, sign-2b) | Needs adaptation | Helpline, problem gambling info |
| Digital sign (sign-3a, sign-3b) | Needs adaptation | Helpline in rotation, problem gambling info |

### Content that is compliant as-is

The following {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content categories are **compliant without adaptation** (they don't constitute advertising):

| Content | Why compliant |
|---|---|
| Brand book chapters | Internal guidelines, not player-facing advertising |
| Messaging framework | Copy reference, not published advertising |
| Staff FAQ | Internal document |
| Player segment profiles | Internal audience research |
| Conversation scripts | Staff training, not advertising |
| Glossary | Reference document |

### Key simplification vs. BC

Nevada compliance is simpler than BC for advertising templates because:
1. **No mandatory statement** — no `{{MANDATORY_STATEMENT}}` token needed
2. **Fewer required elements** — primarily helpline + 21+ (vs. BC's statement + helpline + 19+ + GameSense)
3. **Flexible phrasing** — {{PROGRAM_NAME}} on-brand language can be used without constraints
4. **No national advertising code** — AGA is voluntary (vs. Canada's enforceable national code)
