| **Online gambling** | {{ONLINE_STATUS}} |
| **Permitted products** | {{PRODUCTS}} |

### Permitted products table

| Product | Legal status | Regulator | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| {{PRODUCT}} | {{STATUS}} | {{REGULATOR}} | {{NOTES}} |
| {{PRODUCT}} | {{STATUS}} | {{REGULATOR}} | {{NOTES}} |

---

## Helpline

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name** | {{HELPLINE_NAME}} |
| **Phone** | {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}} |
| **Website** | {{HELPLINE_WEBSITE}} |
| **Hours** | {{HOURS}} |
| **Languages** | {{LANGUAGES}} |
| **Cost** | Free |

### Display rules

{{Describe where and how the helpline must be displayed. Include:
- Minimum size/prominence requirements
- Which touchpoints require display
- Whether the helpline name must appear alongside the number
- Any specific formatting requirements}}

### On-brand helpline display

**Bare compliance** (what most operators do):
> "{{BARE_COMPLIANCE_HELPLINE_MESSAGE}}"

**On-brand compliance** (the {{PROGRAM_NAME}} way):
> {{ON_BRAND_HELPLINE_MESSAGE}}

*Pattern from: [Messaging Framework — Warning Statement Standards](../../brand-book/05-messaging-framework.md#warning-statement-standards)*

---

## Mandatory messaging

### Required statements

| Statement | Exact wording | Where required | Can it be paraphrased? |
|---|---|---|---|
| {{STATEMENT_NAME}} | "{{EXACT_WORDING}}" | {{PLACEMENT}} | {{YES_NO}} |
| {{STATEMENT_NAME}} | "{{EXACT_WORDING}}" | {{PLACEMENT}} | {{YES_NO}} |

### On-brand integration

For each mandatory statement, show two versions:

**Bare compliance:**
> "{{MANDATORY_STATEMENT}}"

**{{PROGRAM_NAME}} on-brand version:**
> {{Surround the mandatory statement with on-brand context. The required words appear exactly as mandated, but the surrounding copy uses Playbook voice and adds a helpful CTA.}}

**Rules for on-brand integration:**
1. The mandatory statement appears word-for-word — never paraphrase legally required language
2. Surround it with on-brand context that adds value (a CTA, additional information, welcoming framing)
3. Give it visual dignity — don't shrink it to minimum size
4. Follow it with a helpful action whenever possible

*Pattern from: [Messaging Framework — Warning Statement Standards](../../brand-book/05-messaging-framework.md#warning-statement-standards)*

## Self-exclusion

| Field | Value |

| **Scope** | {{SCOPE}} *(single operator / province-wide / national)* |
| **Enrollment method** | {{METHOD}} |
| **Reinstatement** | {{REINSTATEMENT_RULES}} |

### {{PROGRAM_NAME}} language mapping

Map self-exclusion terminology to {{PROGRAM_NAME}}'s two-tier system:

| Context | {{PROGRAM_NAME}} term | Official term | When to use official term |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 (casual) | "Take a break" / "Pause your account" | {{OFFICIAL_TERM}} | Never in Tier 1 |
| Tier 2 (formal) | "Self-exclusion" | {{OFFICIAL_TERM}} | Legal documents, formal enrollment |
| Staff training | Both | {{OFFICIAL_TERM}} | When explaining the program's official name |

### Staff FAQ addition

Add this Q&A to the [Staff FAQ](../../collateral/customer-service/staff-faq.md):

> **Q: What is {{SELF_EXCLUSION_PROGRAM}}?**
>
> {{SELF_EXCLUSION_PROGRAM}} is {{JURISDICTION_NAME}}'s {{SCOPE}} self-exclusion program. Players can exclude themselves for {{DURATIONS}}. During exclusion, they cannot enter {{SCOPE_DETAILS}}. If a player asks about it, explain the options and offer to help them get started. Use "take a break" in casual conversation, "{{SELF_EXCLUSION_PROGRAM}}" when referring to the specific program.

## Player protection tools

### Required tools

| Tool | Required? | Threshold/Details |
|---|---|---|
| Deposit limits | {{YES_NO}} | {{DETAILS}} |
| Loss limits | {{YES_NO}} | {{DETAILS}} |
| Session time limits | {{YES_NO}} | {{DETAILS}} |
| Cool-off periods | {{YES_NO}} | {{DETAILS}} |
| Activity statements | {{YES_NO}} | {{DETAILS}} |
| Reality checks / pop-ups | {{YES_NO}} | {{DETAILS}} |

### {{PROGRAM_NAME}} tool messaging

For each required tool, use {{PROGRAM_NAME}} language:

| Tool | {{PROGRAM_NAME}} framing | Example copy |
|---|---|---|
| Deposit limits | "Set your deposit limit" | "Play on your terms. Set your deposit limit in 10 seconds." |
| Session limits | "Set a session reminder" | "Lost track of time? Session reminders keep you aware." |

---

## Age verification

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Minimum age** | {{MIN_AGE}}+ |
| **`_brand.yml` key** | `legal.minimum_gambling_age.{{jurisdiction-key}}` |
| **`{{MIN_AGE}}` token value** | {{MIN_AGE}} |
| **Verification method** | {{METHOD}} |
| **Reverification** | {{REQUIREMENTS}} |

### Age messaging

All collateral in this jurisdiction must display `{{MIN_AGE}}+` age notice. Update the disclaimers section of `_brand.yml`:

```yaml
legal:
  disclaimers:
    age: "You must be {{MIN_AGE}}+ to gamble."
```

---

## AML/KYC

| Requirement | Value |
|---|---|
| **AML authority** | {{AML_AUTHORITY}} |
| **KYC threshold** | {{THRESHOLD}} |
| **Reporting requirements** | {{REQUIREMENTS}} |
| **Player-facing impact** | {{WHAT_PLAYERS_EXPERIENCE}} |

### Player-facing messaging

When AML/KYC processes affect players (identity verification, source of funds checks), use {{PROGRAM_NAME}} voice:

**Bare compliance:**
> "We are required by law to verify your identity."

**On-brand:**
> "Quick ID check — it keeps your account secure and is required for all players. Takes about 2 minutes."
