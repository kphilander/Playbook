## BC advertising principles

### Sources of advertising requirements

BC gambling advertising is governed by three overlapping layers:

| Layer | Source | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **Provincial** | GPEB/IGCO licence conditions and directives | All gambling advertising in BC |
| **BCLC** | BCLC Advertising and Marketing Standards | All BCLC-operated gambling (which is all legal gambling in BC) |
| **National** | Canadian Gambling Advertising Code (January 2026) | All gambling advertising in Canada |

Because BCLC operates all legal gambling in BC, its advertising standards effectively set the floor for any content that appears in connection with BC gambling operations — including {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content.

### Core principles

| Principle | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Truthful and accurate** | All claims must be factual. Odds and probability statements must be mathematically correct. |
| **Not misleading** | Must not create false impressions about likelihood of winning, prize sizes, or the nature of gambling |
| **Socially responsible** | Must not portray excessive or irresponsible gambling positively |
| **Not targeting minors** | Content, imagery, language, placement, and media buying must not target or disproportionately appeal to persons under 19 |
| **Includes responsible gambling messaging** | Every ad must include "Know your limit, play within it." and a helpline reference |
| **Does not exploit vulnerability** | Must not portray gambling as a solution to financial, personal, or social problems |

## Canadian Gambling Advertising Code

The **Canadian Gambling Advertising Code** came into effect in **January 2026**. It is administered by **Advertising Standards Canada (Ad Standards)** and applies to all gambling advertising across Canada. While it is an industry self-regulatory code (not legislation), it is enforceable through Ad Standards' complaints process and carries significant industry weight.

### Full provisions

| # | Provision | Details |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Truthfulness** | Advertisements must be truthful, fair, and accurate. Must not misrepresent products or services. |
| 2 | **Minors** | Advertisements must not be directed at minors or use themes, imagery, language, or characters that primarily appeal to minors. Must not feature anyone under 25 gambling. |
| 3 | **Misleading claims** | Must not misrepresent the likelihood, size, or frequency of winning. Must not suggest that skill can influence the outcome of games of chance. |
| 4 | **Inducements** | Bonus offers and promotions must include clear, prominent terms and conditions. Must not be the primary message of the advertisement. |
| 5 | **Social responsibility** | Must not portray gambling as a means of financial advancement, solving problems, or achieving social success. Must not suggest gambling is essential for enjoyment or social acceptance. |
| 6 | **Responsible gambling** | All advertising must include a responsible gambling message and a reference to a helpline or support resource. |
| 7 | **Endorsements** | Celebrity, athlete, and influencer endorsements must comply with disclosure requirements. Endorsers must be 25+. |
| 8 | **Frequency** | Self-regulatory limits on advertising frequency during live sports broadcasts. No more than one gambling ad per commercial break during live sports. |
| 9 | **Digital/social media** | Age-gating on digital platforms. Gambling content must be targeted to 19+ audiences (or 18+ in AB/MB/QC). Must use platform age-restriction tools. |
| 10 | **Complaints** | Complaints are handled through Ad Standards Canada's Consumer Complaints process. Advertisers must comply with decisions. |

### Interaction with BC rules

The national code **adds to** BC's provincial rules — it does not replace them. Where the national code and BC rules overlap, the stricter requirement applies:

| Area | BC rule | National code | Which applies |
|---|---|---|---|
| Age targeting | Under 19 | Under 19 (or provincial age) | Same — 19 in BC |
| Endorser age | Not specified | Must be 25+ | National code (stricter) |
| Sports ad frequency | Not specified | 1 per commercial break | National code (new) |
| Helpline in ads | Required | Required | Both — same requirement |
| Mandatory statement | "Know your limit, play within it." | "Responsible gambling message" | BC rule (more specific) |
| Inducement messaging | Limited | Terms must be prominent | Both apply |

## Required disclosures

Every piece of gambling advertising in BC must include these elements:

| Disclosure | Format | Minimum prominence |
|---|---|---|
| **"Know your limit, play within it."** | Exact wording, no paraphrase | Same size as main body copy; 14pt minimum in print; 3-second minimum on screen; spoken at normal pace in audio |
| **Helpline: 1-888-795-6111** | Phone number | 14pt bold minimum in print; clearly visible on screen; spoken clearly in audio |
| **Age restriction: 19+** | "19+" or "You must be 19+ to gamble" | Visible in all advertising |
| **Terms and conditions** | For any bonus, promotion, or offer | Clear, legible, accessible — not hidden in fine print |
| **Odds/probability** | If odds are referenced | Must be mathematically accurate |

### On-brand disclosure integration

Rather than treating disclosures as fine print to minimize, {{PROGRAM_NAME}} treats them as content to design well:

**Typical approach** (disclosures as afterthought):
> *[main ad content]*
> *^Know your limit, play within it. Must be 19+. Gambling Support BC: 1-888-795-6111.*

**{{PROGRAM_NAME}} approach** (disclosures as designed content):
> *[main ad content]*
>
> **Know your limit, play within it.** You're 19+ and you're in charge of your play.
> Free, confidential support: **1-888-795-6111** | gamblingsupportbc.ca
