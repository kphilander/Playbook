**Myth 18 post**: "Can you make a living from gambling? A tiny number of people do. They treat it like a job with spreadsheets, bankroll rules, and bad weeks. For 99%+ of players, gambling is entertainment — with a cost. That's fine. Just know which one you are. #KnowYourGame"

### Tone guidance

This is the campaign where it's easiest to slip into preachiness. Check every piece of copy against the brand voice:

- **Don't**: "Please be careful with your money." (compliance voice)
- **Do**: "Set your limit before you play — it's a power move." (The Good Friend)
- **Don't**: "Problem gambling can lead to financial hardship." (public health voice)

### KPIs

- Feature adoption: deposit limit setup rate from campaign CTAs
- Social engagement (expect high comment volume — money topics generate discussion)
- Blog read-through on chasing losses article
- Email click-through to limit-setting feature

## Campaign sequencing

For operators running multiple campaigns, this order maximizes impact:

| Order | Campaign | Why this sequence |
|---|---|---|
| 1st | Game IQ Challenge | Builds engagement and audience. Social-first. Low barrier. |
| 2nd | Slots Myths Week | Largest player segment. High relatability. |
| 3rd | Sports Betting Reality Check | Time to a major sporting event. |
| 4th | The Money Myths | Builds on literacy established in campaigns 1–3. |
| 5th | Luck, Numbers & Lotteries | Lighter tone. Good palette cleanser. |
| 6th | Beat the House? Table Games | Most niche audience. Deploy to engaged segment. |

**Cadence**: Allow 1–2 weeks between campaigns to avoid fatigue. Mix myth-busting with tool promotion and general brand content between campaigns.
