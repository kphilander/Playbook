### Tone guidance

This is the campaign where it's easiest to slip into preachiness. Check every piece of copy against the brand voice:
- **Do**: "Here's the math. Now you know." (The Sharp)
- **Don't**: "Please be careful with your money." (compliance voice)
- **Do**: "Set your limit before you play — it's a power move." (The Good Friend)
- **Don't**: "Problem gambling can lead to financial hardship." (public health voice)

### KPIs

- Feature adoption: deposit limit setup rate from campaign CTAs
- Social engagement (expect high comment volume — money topics generate discussion)
- Blog read-through on chasing losses article
- Email click-through to limit-setting feature

## Campaign 7: Know Your Game

**Theme**: Game education — teach players how the games they love actually work.

**Duration**: 2 weeks

**Source content**: [How to Play guides](../how-to-play/) (slots, blackjack, roulette, sports betting)

**Primary channels**: Social cards, blog articles, email series

**Audience**: All player segments — particularly new-to-game and casual players

### Concept

This campaign flips the script from myth-busting ("that's not true") to game education ("here's how it actually works"). Instead of correcting misconceptions, it proactively teaches players the rules, bet types, and math behind their favorite games. The tone is empowering, not corrective — players finish feeling smarter, not scolded.

Each game gets 2–3 days of content. The campaign opens with a universal hook ("Do you know how your favorite game works?"), cycles through game-specific education, and closes with the odds comparison infographic as a capstone.

## Campaign sequencing

For operators running multiple campaigns, this order maximizes impact:

| Order | Campaign | Why this sequence |
|---|---|---|
| 1st | Game IQ Challenge | Builds engagement and audience. Social-first. Low barrier. |
| 2nd | Know Your Game | Proactive education while audience is engaged. Pairs well with quiz. |
| 3rd | Slots Myths Week | Largest player segment. High relatability. |
| 4th | Sports Betting Reality Check | Time to a major sporting event. |
| 5th | The Money Myths | Builds on literacy established in campaigns 1–4. |
| 6th | Luck, Numbers & Lotteries | Lighter tone. Good palette cleanser. |
| 7th | Beat the House? Table Games | Most niche audience. Deploy to engaged segment. |

**Cadence**: Allow 1–2 weeks between campaigns to avoid fatigue. Mix myth-busting with tool promotion and general brand content between campaigns.
