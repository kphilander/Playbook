# Tagline System

The complete tagline hierarchy, rotation guidance, and operational framework for {{PROGRAM_NAME}}. Playbook uses a tagline *system* — not a single prescribed tagline. Operators choose from the inventory, mix and match across campaigns, or use the framework to write their own.

> **Operator note**: Pick 2–3 taglines as your primary rotation per campaign cycle. You can mix pillars — an Open tagline for educational content and a Social tagline for quiz promotion works well together. See `_brand.yml` under `messaging > taglines` for the configured defaults.

## Channel adaptation

The same tagline works differently across channels. Here's how to adapt without losing the message.

### Character count constraints by channel

| Channel | Max chars | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hero banner | 50 | Paired with visual, needs breathing room |
| Social post (primary text) | 40 | First line before "more" truncation |
| Email subject line | 50 | Including preview text strategy |
| In-app notification | 65 | One-line format, must be scannable |
| Push notification | 50 | Title only; body is separate |

### Adaptation examples

**Tagline O-3**: "The odds are public. Now you know them." (39 chars)

## Rotation guidance

### Campaign pairing recommendations

| Campaign type | Recommended primary | Recommended secondary | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Myth-busting | O-4 "Every game has math. Here's yours." | S-1 "Share the facts." | Education + shareability |
| Quiz launch | S-8 "Think you know? Prove it." | O-3 "The odds are public." | Competition + knowledge |
| Tool promotion | T-1 "Your tools. Your rules." | O-8 "Know the math. Play your way." | Empowerment + context |
| Seasonal event | O-1 "Here's how it actually works." | S-2 "Challenge your friends." | Relevance + engagement |
| Support awareness | H-2 "No judgment. Just support." | H-1 "Here when you need us." | Accessibility + warmth |

### Rotation rules

1. **Don't repeat the same tagline in consecutive touchpoints.** If a player sees O-1 on the landing page, use O-4 or S-3 in the follow-up email.
2. **Pair Open + Social for maximum reach.** Open earns credibility; Social drives distribution.
3. **Use Tools taglines at action moments.** Deposit screens, settings pages, feature prompts — not awareness campaigns.
4. **Reserve Help taglines for Tier 2 proximity.** Always present, never the primary message in Tier 1 contexts.
5. **Rotate taglines within a campaign.** A 2-week campaign should use 2–3 different taglines across its touchpoints.

### Seasonal rotation calendar

| Quarter | Suggested primary | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 (Jan–Mar) | O-8 "Know the math. Play your way." | New Year fresh-start energy |
| Q2 (Apr–Jun) | S-4 "How well do you really know the odds?" | Quiz / engagement season |
| Q3 (Jul–Sep) | O-1 "Here's how it actually works." | Sports pre-season education |
| Q4 (Oct–Dec) | T-3 "Play on your terms." | Holiday entertainment framing |

## Writing new taglines

Operators can create custom taglines that fit their brand. Use this framework to stay on-brand.

### The 5-point tagline test

Every new tagline must pass all five:

1. **Specific over generic.** Does it name something concrete? "Know the odds" beats "Play smart."
2. **Active over passive.** Does it use active voice? "Set your limits" beats "Limits can be set."
3. **Player-empowering.** Does it position the player as the one in control? "Your call" beats "Our recommendation."
4. **Read-aloud ready.** Say it out loud. Does it sound like something a friend would say? If it sounds like a legal disclaimer, rewrite.
5. **Under 50 characters.** Can it fit in a push notification title? If not, tighten it.

### Tagline formula

The strongest Playbook taglines follow one of these patterns:

**Pattern 1: Fact + "Now you know"**
> "The house edge is 5.26%. Now you know."
> Structure: [Concrete fact] + [Empowerment close]

**Pattern 2: Action imperative**
> "Know the math. Play your way."
> Structure: [What to do] + [Why it matters]

**Pattern 3: Challenge / question**
> "How well do you really know the odds?"
> Structure: [Provoke curiosity] + [Imply the answer is available]

**Pattern 4: Short declaration**
> "No fine print. Just facts."
> Structure: [What we don't do] + [What we do]

### Creating your tagline: step by step

1. **Start with the player's benefit.** What does the player gain from this message?
2. **Pick a pattern** from the four above.
3. **Draft 5 versions.** Don't self-edit yet.
4. **Run each through the 5-point test.** Cut any that fail.
5. **Read the survivors aloud.** Pick the one that sounds most natural.
6. **Check it against the [avoid list](#dont).** Make sure it doesn't trip any off-brand signals.

### Workshop examples

**Brief**: "We need a tagline for a sports betting odds education campaign."

| Draft | Test result | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| "Bet smarter, not harder." | Fails #1 (generic — what does "smarter" mean?) | Cut |
| "You know the sport. Here's the math." | Passes all 5 | Keep |
| "Responsible sports betting starts here." | Fails #1 (generic), #4 (sounds like compliance) | Cut |
| "The line already knows. Do you?" | Passes all 5 | Keep |
| "Be a better bettor." | Fails #1 (generic), #4 (sounds like a slogan) | Cut |

## Do / Don't

### On-brand taglines

| Tagline | Why it works |
|---|---|
| "Every game has math. Here's yours." | Specific, empowering, personal, reads well aloud |
| "No fine print. Just facts." | Concrete promise, short, confident |
| "The odds are public. Now you know them." | Fact-based, empowering, challenges the status quo |
| "Your tools. Your rules." | Autonomy, ownership, concise |
| "How well do you really know the odds?" | Curiosity-driven, challenging, non-judgmental |

### Off-brand taglines

| Tagline | Why it fails |
|---|---|
| "Gamble Responsibly." | Generic, preachy, no actionable content. The opposite of Playbook. |
| "Play Smart. Play Safe." | Vague — what does "smart" or "safe" mean? No specific behavior named. |
| "When the fun stops, stop." | Assumes players can self-diagnose in the moment. Paternalistic. |
| "Know your limits." | Better, but still generic. Playbook would say "Set your deposit limit." |
| "Bet with your head, not over it." | Unclear meaning. No path to action. Clever wordplay without substance. |
| "Don't let gambling control you." | Fear-based, implies the player has lost control. Alienating. |
| "Think before you bet." | Condescending — implies the player isn't already thinking. |
| "Winners know when to quit." | Implies gambling is about winning/losing. Judgmental framing. |

## Lockup specs

How taglines pair with the {{PROGRAM_NAME}} logo. For full logo specifications, see [`visual-identity/logo/`](../visual-identity/logo/).

### Tagline placement rules

1. **Below the logo** — tagline sits beneath the wordmark with 0.5x logo height spacing.
2. **Same visual weight as "BOOK"** — use the light weight (300) of the heading font, uppercase, letter-spaced.
3. **Never above the logo.** The wordmark always leads.
4. **Never replace the logo.** The tagline supplements; it doesn't substitute.
5. **Maximum one tagline per lockup.** Don't stack multiple taglines.

### Lockup configurations

| Layout | Tagline position | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| Stacked logo + tagline | Tagline centered below the stacked wordmark | Hero banners, posters, splash screens |
| Horizontal logo + tagline | Tagline right-aligned after the horizontal wordmark, separated by a pipe | Headers, email signatures, compact spaces |
| Logo only (no tagline) | — | Favicons, app icons, small-format placements under 120px wide |

### Sizing

- **Minimum tagline size**: 10px / 7pt (for legibility at small sizes)
- **Tagline must never be larger than the logo wordmark.** If the logo is at minimum size, omit the tagline.
- **Clear space**: The tagline sits within the logo's clear space zone — no additional padding required beyond the logo's own clear space.

### Color pairing

The tagline follows the same color rules as the logo:

| Background | Logo color | Tagline color |
|---|---|---|
| Light (neutral_50, white) | primary (#1B2838) | neutral_700 (#3D3D5C) |
| Dark (primary, neutral_900) | white (#FFFFFF) | neutral_300 (#A8A8C0) |
| Brand (secondary, accent) | primary (#1B2838) | primary (#1B2838) at 70% opacity |
