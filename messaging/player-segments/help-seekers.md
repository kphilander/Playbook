# Help-Seekers

Messaging for players actively looking for support or considering self-exclusion. This segment has self-identified a concern — speed, clarity, and zero judgment are critical.

> **Operator note**: This is Tier 2 territory. Humor is off. Marketing language is off. Every word should reduce friction and increase clarity. The player is looking for help — make it instantly findable. Test every page in this flow for time-to-action: a player in distress should reach support in under 10 seconds. See the [Stigma-Free Language Guide](../stigma-free-language.md) for terminology.

## Segment profile

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Who** | Players who have self-identified a concern about their gambling |
| **State of mind** | May be in crisis, may be reflective, may be exploring options calmly |
| **What they need** | Clear pathways to help. Fast. No barriers. |
| **What they're feeling** | Vulnerability, uncertainty, possibly shame or anxiety |
| **Relationship to tools** | May have used them, may have avoided them. Doesn't matter now. |
| **Content receptivity** | High for practical help. Zero for educational content, quizzes, or entertainment. |

**Important**: This segment is diverse. Some players arrive in acute distress. Others arrive calmly, having thought about it for weeks. The messaging must work for both — calm enough for the reflective player, clear enough for the person in crisis.

## Key insight

> **Speed, clarity, and zero judgment are critical. This is Tier 2 territory. Every extra click, every extra word, every moment of hesitation costs.**

A player looking for help has already overcome the hardest barrier: deciding to look. The messaging must not create new barriers. No registration walls before help pages. No "are you sure?" confirmation dialogs on self-exclusion. No marketing copy between the player and the resource.

---

## Message priorities

In order of importance for this segment:

1. **Clear pathways to help** — Phone, text, chat, self-exclusion. Visible, prominent, immediate.
2. **Validation** — "You're doing the right thing." "This is a brave step." Brief, genuine, non-patronizing.
3. **Confidentiality assurance** — "Free. Confidential. No judgment." Repeat as needed. It matters.
4. **Simplicity** — One action per screen. No choices that don't matter. No distractions.
5. **Continuity** — What happens next? What to expect after calling, after self-excluding, after pausing.

---

## Tone guidance

**Primary archetype**: The Good Friend — serious mode. Warm and direct. No humor. No wit. No cleverness.

| Register | When to use with this segment |
|---|---|
| **Warm / Direct** | Everything. This is the only register for help-seekers. |
| **Playful / Witty** | Never. Not in any context. |
| **Confident / Informative** | Only for factual statements about process (e.g., "Self-exclusion takes effect immediately"). |
| **Celebratory** | Only post-action: "Your account is paused. Take all the time you need." Quiet, not effusive. |

### Voice characteristics for this segment

- **Short sentences.** Maximum 15 words.
- **Simple words.** No jargon. No euphemisms.
- **Direct structure.** Subject-verb-object. No embedded clauses.
- **Second person.** "You can..." not "Players may..."
- **Present tense.** "Support is available now." Not "Support will be available."

### Post-exclusion confirmation

>

### Re-engagement after pause (if they return)

> "Welcome back. Your tools are still set up. If you'd like to review your settings or talk to someone before you start, everything is one tap away."

> "You're back. No rush. Your limits are still active. Adjust them anytime in settings."

## Resource formatting

Help resources must be formatted for instant usability. No hunting, no scrolling, no guessing.

### Display rules

1. **Phone number first.** Always the most prominent element. Large text, high contrast.
2. **Multiple channels.** Call, text, chat — give options. Not everyone wants to talk on the phone.
3. **Operating hours.** If 24/7, say so. If not, show exact hours in the player's timezone.
4. **No registration required.** Support resources must be accessible without logging in.
5. **No interstitials.** No "are you sure?" dialogs between the player and the helpline number.

### Standard resource block

```
Free, confidential support — 24/7

Call: {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}
Text: {{TEXT_NUMBER}}
Chat: {{CHAT_URL}}

No question is too small. No judgment. Ever.
```

## What to avoid

| Don't | Why | Do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Use playful or witty tone | A player looking for help doesn't need humor. It feels dismissive. | Warm, direct, clear. Every word. |
| Use marketing language | "Check out our great tools!" feels insulting in this context. | "Here's how to get support." |
| Add friction | Confirmation dialogs, "are you sure?" prompts, and extra steps create barriers. | Fewest clicks possible. One action per screen. |
| Require login for help | A player who wants to self-exclude shouldn't need to log in first. | Help pages accessible without authentication. |
| Use guilt | "Think about your family" or "Consider the consequences" — shame drives avoidance. | "Support is available. Free. Confidential." |
| Bury resources | Helpline number in small text at the bottom of a long page. | Helpline number visible without scrolling. |
| Over-validate | "We're so proud of you for taking this step!" can feel patronizing. | "You've come to the right place." Simple. Genuine. Brief. |
| Include educational content | Quizzes, odds explainers, and myth-busters are irrelevant here. | Focus exclusively on pathways to support. |
| Use the word "problem" | "If you have a gambling problem" is a gatekeeper phrase. | "For any question about gambling." |
| Make help feel permanent | "This is a serious decision" creates fear. | "You can pause for as long as you need. It's your choice." |
