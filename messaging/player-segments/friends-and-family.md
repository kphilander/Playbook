# Friends and Family

Messaging for people concerned about someone else's gambling. This audience needs guidance on how to help without enabling or confronting — and clear pathways to support for themselves.

> **Operator note**: This segment is often overlooked. Friends and family are not players — they're people worried about someone they care about. They need different content, different tone, and different resources. Don't repurpose player-facing content for this audience. Write specifically for them. See [Voice and Tone](../../brand-book/04-voice-and-tone.md) for the full framework.

## Segment profile

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Who** | Partners, parents, children, siblings, friends of someone whose gambling concerns them |
| **Demographics** | Broad — any age, any background |
| **Relationship to gambling** | Non-players or light players. Not here for themselves. |
| **State of mind** | Worried, frustrated, unsure, possibly exhausted from trying to help |
| **What they need** | Recognition signs (behavioral, not diagnostic), conversation guidance, support resources |
| **Content receptivity** | High for practical guidance. Low for clinical checklists. |

---

## Key insight

> **They need guidance on how to help without enabling or confronting. Recognition of behavioral changes — not diagnostic checklists. Conversation starters — not ultimatum scripts. Support for themselves — not just for the person they're worried about.**

Friends and family often feel powerless. They can see something is wrong but don't know what to say, how to say it, or whether saying anything will make it worse. Playbook content for this segment provides practical, non-judgmental guidance that respects both the concerned person and the person they're worried about.

---

## Message priorities

In order of importance for this segment:

1. **Behavioral recognition** — What changes to notice. Framed as behavioral patterns, not clinical symptoms. "Changes you might see" not "warning signs."
2. **Conversation guidance** — How to start a conversation. What to say. What not to say. Practical scripts, not theoretical advice.
3. **Support for themselves** — Friends and family need their own support. Counseling, peer groups, helplines that serve concerned others.
4. **Boundaries** — How to be supportive without enabling. This is hard and important.
5. **Self-care** — Caring about someone's gambling is stressful. Their wellbeing matters too.

## Tone guidance

This segment gets warmth, empathy, and practical help. No humor. No wit. No odds education. They're not here for entertainment content — they're here because they're worried about someone.

|---|---|
| **Warm / Direct** | Everything. Conversation guides, resource pages, landing page copy. |
| **Confident / Informative** | Only for factual statements about support options and how to access them. |
| **Playful / Witty** | Never. |
| **Celebratory** | Never. |

## Sample messages

### Landing page

> "Worried about someone's gambling? You're not alone, and you don't have to figure this out by yourself."

> "If someone you care about is gambling more than usual — or differently than before — this page is for you."

> "Noticing changes in someone's behavior can be unsettling. Here's how to start a conversation and where to find support."

### Behavioral recognition guide

> **Changes you might notice**
>
> These aren't diagnostic criteria. They're behavioral patterns that friends and family sometimes observe. Not all of them mean there's a problem — but if several feel familiar, it may be worth starting a conversation.
>
> - Spending more time gambling than before
> - Being secretive about time or money
> - Borrowing money or having unexplained financial stress
> - Mood changes tied to gambling outcomes — excitement after wins, irritability after losses
> - Withdrawing from activities they used to enjoy
> - Talking about "winning it back" or needing "one more bet"
> - Minimizing or denying how much time or money they spend
> - Missing commitments — work, social events, family time

### "How to talk about it" guide

> **Starting the conversation**
>
> There's no perfect script. But there are approaches that tend to work better than others.
>
> **Do**:
> - Pick a calm, private moment. Not during or right after gambling.
> - Use "I" statements: "I've noticed..." "I'm concerned about..." "I care about you."
> - Focus on behavior you've observed, not labels: "You've been spending a lot more time on the app" rather than "You have a gambling problem."
> - Listen more than you talk. Let them respond.
> - Offer support: "I'm here if you want to talk about it."
> - Mention that help is available: "There are free, confidential support services if you ever want to explore them."
>
> **Don't**:
> - Issue ultimatums in the first conversation.
> - Use labels: "You're a gambling addict" will end the conversation immediately.
> - Try to control their behavior. You can influence, not force.
> - Expect one conversation to change everything. It's a process.
> - Take over their finances without their involvement.

> **If they're not ready to talk**
>
> That's okay. You've opened the door. They know you've noticed and you care. Sometimes that's enough for now.
>
> "You don't have to talk about it today. I just want you to know I'm here, and there's no judgment."

## Resource formatting

Resources for friends and family should be formatted distinctly from player-facing resources.

### Display rules

1. **Acknowledge the audience.** "Support for you" — not just generic helpline numbers.
2. **Include F&F-specific organizations.** Gam-Anon, GamCare family support, local family counseling services.
3. **Mention that helplines serve concerned others.** Many people don't realize they can call too.
4. **Separate from player resources.** Don't mix player-facing tools (deposit limits, dashboards) with F&F content.
5. **Include financial resources.** Financial stress is often the most concrete impact on families.

### Standard resource block for F&F

```
Support for families and friends

Call: {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}
(Helplines support concerned others too — not just players)

Family support groups: gam-anon.org
Financial counseling: [local resource]

You don't have to figure this out alone.
```

## What to avoid

| Don't | Why | Do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Use blaming language | "Your loved one is a problem gambler" assigns a label and creates defensiveness. | "If you've noticed changes in someone's gambling patterns..." |
| Promote "tough love" | Ultimatums and confrontations often backfire and damage relationships. | Encourage conversation, not confrontation. |
| Provide diagnostic checklists | Clinical symptom checklists make friends/family feel like they need to diagnose someone. | Describe behavioral changes instead: "changes you might notice." |
| Focus only on the player | Friends and family need support too. Their wellbeing matters. | Include resources specifically for the concerned person. |
| Use clinical language | "Intervention," "enabling," "codependency" — all clinically loaded. | "Conversation," "boundaries," "support." |
| Promise results | "If you follow these steps, they'll get help" — you can't guarantee that. | "Starting a conversation is a meaningful step. The rest is up to them." |
| Recommend controlling finances | "Take away their credit cards" can damage trust and autonomy. | "A financial counselor can help you both understand your options." |
| Ignore the emotional toll | Worrying about someone's gambling is exhausting and stressful. | Acknowledge it: "This is hard. You're doing the right thing by looking for guidance." |
