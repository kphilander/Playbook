## Key insight

> **They see gambling as entertainment. Messaging should reinforce this framing while adding information that makes the entertainment better.**

General players don't think they need education about gambling. They're not looking for help. They're not worried. They're having fun. The challenge is making Playbook content interesting enough that they *choose* to engage with it — not because they think they need it, but because it's genuinely worth their time.

Content that feels like a warning will be dismissed. Content that feels like insider knowledge will be consumed.

---

## Message priorities

In order of importance for this segment:

1. **Odds literacy** — How games actually work, house edge, RNG, probability. Framed as interesting information, not cautionary tales.
2. **Tool awareness** — Deposit limits, session reminders, activity dashboards. Framed as features that enhance the experience, not safety nets.
3. **Entertainment framing** — Gambling as a cost-of-entertainment model. "Your entertainment budget" not "your gambling money."
4. **Myth-busting** — Common misconceptions about how games work. Playful, confident, shareable.
5. **Social proof** — Facts and knowledge that make the player feel smart and informed. Content worth sharing.

| **Warm / Direct** | Onboarding, session check-ins, limit-reached moments |
| **Celebratory** | Quiz results, first limit set, tool activation milestones |

**Secondary register**: Sam — supportive mode — for feature onboarding and practical tool setup.

## Sample messages by touchpoint

### Onboarding

> "Welcome. Before you dive in, here are three things that take less than a minute and make everything better."

> "New here? Start with the 60-second odds quiz. Most people get question 3 wrong."

> "Set your budget, set your pace, check your game IQ. Three steps. Under a minute. You're ready."

### Deposit flow

> "Setting a deposit limit? Think of it as your entertainment budget for the week. You pick the number."

> "Your deposit limit is your call. Set it once and play without second-guessing."

> "How far can your {{AMOUNT}} go this weekend? The bankroll planner has answers."

### Session reminder

> "You've been playing for {{DURATION}}. Most sessions average about 45 minutes. Set a session reminder?"

> "Time flies when you're playing. That's by design. Here's your check-in."

> "Quick check-in: {{DURATION}} so far. Still having fun? Your tools are one tap away."

### Post-play

> "Session over. Your activity summary has the full picture — sessions, spending, play patterns."

> "Want to see how your session stacked up? Your dashboard has the breakdown."

> "Thanks for playing. Your limits and tools are always here when you come back."

### Re-engagement

> "Been a while? Your tools are still set up. Your dashboard has your recent activity."

> "Your game IQ quiz results from last time: 7/10. Think you can beat it? New questions are live."

> "The odds haven't changed. But we've added some new content worth checking out."

## CTAs that work

This segment responds best to curiosity-driven and quiz-based CTAs.

| CTA | Why it works | Context |
|---|---|---|
| "Take the quiz" | Challenges their knowledge — they want to prove they're sharp | Quiz promotion, social media |
| "Test your game IQ" | Ego-driven engagement — they believe they'll score well | Onboarding, feature discovery |
| "See the real odds" | Curiosity — they want to know what they might not know | Odds explainers, game selection |
| "See how it works" | Interest in mechanics — they're engaged with the product | Game guides, RNG explainers |
| "Set your budget" | Practical and empowering — frames them as in control | Deposit flow, onboarding |
| "Challenge a friend" | Social competition — extends reach through peer sharing | Quiz results, myth-busters |
| "Share the facts" | Social proof — makes them the smart one in their group | Educational content, social posts |

### CTAs that don't work for this segment

| CTA | Why it fails |
|---|---|
| "Get help" | Implies they need help. They don't think they do. |
| "Gamble responsibly" | Vague, preachy, implies they're being irresponsible. |
| "Are you at risk?" | Pathologizing. They'll click away immediately. |
| "Learn to control your gambling" | Implies they've lost control. Alienating. |

## What to avoid

| Don't | Why | Do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Imply they have a problem | General players will tune out content they perceive as "not for me." | Frame all messaging as universally useful information. |
| Use clinical language | "Gambling behavior," "risk factors," "problem gambling" — none of this resonates. | Use "play patterns," "odds," "your activity." |
| Lead with warnings | Fear-based messaging causes avoidance, not engagement. | Lead with interesting facts. Make them want to read more. |
| Be preachy | "You should set a budget" sounds like a lecture. | "Set your budget. Play without second-guessing." |
| Treat tools as safety nets | "These tools protect you" implies danger. | "These features enhance your experience." |
| Assume they're uninformed | They may know more than you think. Respect their intelligence. | "Here's something worth knowing" — not "Did you know?" |
