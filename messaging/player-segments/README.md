# Player Segments

Targeted messaging profiles for six key audiences. Each profile includes demographics, motivations, messaging priorities, tone adjustments, and ready-to-use copy examples.

## Segments

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [General Players](general-players.md) | The broad audience — recreational gamblers who play for entertainment |
| [Young Adults](young-adults.md) | 18-25 demographic — mobile-first, social-media-native, sports betting and iGaming focused |
| [Sports Bettors](sports-bettors.md) | Skill-oriented audience who value data, analysis, and informed decision-making |
| [At-Risk Players](at-risk-players.md) | Players showing early warning signs — escalating spend, chasing losses, schedule disruption |
| [Friends and Family](friends-and-family.md) | People concerned about someone else's gambling — partners, parents, friends |
| [Help-Seekers](help-seekers.md) | Players actively looking for support — self-exclusion, helplines, cooling-off periods |

## How to use these

Each profile adapts the core Playbook voice for its audience. When creating segment-specific content:

1. Start with the segment profile for tone and messaging priorities
2. Pull copy from [`core-messages.md`](../core-messages.md) and [`calls-to-action.md`](../calls-to-action.md)
3. Check [`stigma-free-language.md`](../stigma-free-language.md) — especially important for at-risk and help-seeker segments
