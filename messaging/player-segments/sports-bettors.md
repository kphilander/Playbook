# Sports Bettors

Messaging for sports fans who bet — often with strong opinions about their sport knowledge and high confidence in their analysis. This segment requires respect for what they know while adding the mathematical context most bettors lack.

> **Operator note**: Sports bettors are the segment most likely to believe they have an edge. They know their sport. They follow the news. They do research. The challenge is helping them understand that sport knowledge and betting edge are not the same thing — without insulting the knowledge they genuinely have. The Sharp archetype at Confident / Informative is your primary register. See [Voice and Tone](../../brand-book/04-voice-and-tone.md) for the full framework.

## Key insight

> **Sport knowledge does not equal a betting edge. The line already prices in everything the bettor knows — and more. Respect their knowledge of the sport while showing that the sportsbook's math works differently from their intuition.**

This is the most ego-sensitive segment. They're proud of their knowledge, and they should be. The problem isn't what they know about their sport — it's what they don't know about how sportsbooks set lines. Playbook content bridges that gap without diminishing the knowledge they bring.

The key distinction: "You know the sport. The sportsbook knows the math. Here's the math."

## Message priorities

In order of importance for this segment:

1. **How lines and odds work** — The mechanics of line-setting, market efficiency, and what "the line already knows." This is the single most impactful piece of education for this segment.
2. **Vig / margin education** — What the sportsbook's cut is, how it works at -110, and why 52.4% is the real break-even point.
3. **Parlay math** — How the house edge compounds per leg. Parlays are disproportionately popular with sports bettors and disproportionately profitable for sportsbooks.
4. **Bankroll management** — Treating the betting bankroll as an entertainment budget. Unit sizing, session budgets, seasonal budgets.
5. **In-play dynamics** — Why watching the game doesn't give you an information edge over algorithms.

## Tone guidance

**Primary archetype**: The Sharp (Confident / Informative)

Respect their knowledge. Add to it. Never talk down. The Sharp is someone who knows the sport *and* the math — and shares the math part because it completes the picture.

| Register | When to use with this segment |
|---|---|
| **Confident / Informative** | Odds education, vig explainers, line-setting mechanics. The primary register. |
| **Playful / Witty** | Myth-busting, social media, quiz hooks. Only when the humor respects their intelligence. |
| **Warm / Direct** | Bankroll check-ins, session reminders, post-loss context. |
| **Celebratory** | Quiz scores, tool activation. Restrained — sports bettors respect substance over celebration. |

### Key tone rule

**Add to their knowledge — never replace it.** "You know the sport. Here's the math behind the odds" positions Playbook as a complement to what they already know, not a correction of it.

## Sample messages

### Pre-event

> "Big game this weekend. Before you place your bets, here's what the -110 line actually means for your bankroll."

> "You've done your research. The sportsbook has too. Here's how lines are set — and why your edge might be smaller than you think."

> "Pregame analysis: solid. Now add the math. A -110 bet means you need to win 52.4% of the time just to break even. Here's why."

### In-play

> "In-play bets move fast. The algorithm adjusts odds in milliseconds. By the time you see the shift, the line has already moved. That's not an edge — it's entertainment."

> "Watching the game gives you information. The algorithm has the same information — and it processes it faster. In-play betting adds excitement, not advantage."

> "Quick in-play check-in: you've placed {{COUNT}} bets in the last {{DURATION}}. Faster decisions usually mean less analysis. Take a breath."

### Post-event

> "Final whistle. Your activity summary has the breakdown for today's bets — results, total wagered, and how the vig affected your return."

> "Win or lose, the math is the same. The vig took its cut on every bet. Your dashboard has the full picture."

> "Great game. Your session summary is ready. Take a look at how your bets played out."

### Parlay education

> "Adding a 4th leg to your parlay? Here's what happens: the house edge roughly doubles or triples. The payout goes up. The sportsbook's cut goes up faster."

> "Parlay math: 2 legs = 25% chance. 3 legs = 12.5%. 4 legs = 6.25%. Each leg multiplies the risk. The payout gets bigger — but it doesn't fully compensate for the added risk."

> "Your 4-leg parlay has a 6.25% chance of hitting and a ~20% house edge. On a single bet, the edge is about 4.5%. That's a big difference."

### Accumulator reality check

> "10-leg accumulator: the payout is impressive. The probability? 0.1%. The sportsbook's edge? Over 40%. Those numbers don't lie."

> "Each leg you add multiplies the sportsbook's advantage. A 10-leg acca looks exciting until you see the math. Here it is."

### Bankroll management

> "Your sports betting budget: treat it like a season pass. Set the total for the season. Divide by weeks. That's your unit."

> "Down for the week? The temptation is to chase it with a big bet. The math says that digs the hole deeper. Your budget resets {{RESET_DATE}}."

> "Bankroll management isn't about limiting fun — it's about making sure you can bet all season instead of going broke in week 3."

### Tipster / social media picks

> "This tipster is 8 for 10 this week? With 10,000 tipsters posting, someone is always on a streak right now. That's statistics, not skill."

> "Before you follow that pick, ask: what's their verified long-term record? 10 picks is noise. 1,000 picks is data."

## Myth connections

This segment maps directly to the sports betting myths in [`myth-busting.md`](../myth-busting.md). Use these for educational content, social media, and campaign material.

| Myth # | Title | Key message for this segment |
|---|---|---|
| 11 | [Knowing the Sport = Winning](../myth-busting.md#myth-11-knowing-the-sport-means-youll-win) | You know the sport. The sportsbook knows the math. The line already prices in your knowledge. |
| 12 | [Parlays Are Smart](../myth-busting.md#myth-12-parlays-are-a-smart-strategy) | The vig compounds per leg. A 4-leg parlay has 4x the house edge of a single bet. |
| 13 | [Following Tipsters](../myth-busting.md#myth-13-following-tipsters-guarantees-profit) | Survivorship bias: you see the winners posting. You don't see the thousands who are quiet. |
| 14 | [In-Play Edge](../myth-busting.md#myth-14-in-play-betting-gives-you-an-edge) | Algorithms adjust in milliseconds. By the time you react, the line has moved. |

**Campaign connection**: Campaign 3 (Sports Betting Reality Check) in [`campaigns.md`](../campaigns.md) is built specifically for this segment.

## What to avoid

| Don't | Why | Do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Imply they don't know their sport | This is the fastest way to lose them. Their knowledge is real and earned. | "You know the sport. Here's the math behind the odds." |
| Use generic "gamble responsibly" | Sports bettors respond to specifics. Generic slogans are background noise. | "The vig on a -110 bet means you need to win 52.4% to break even." |
| Lecture about the dangers of gambling | They don't see sports betting as gambling in the traditional sense. Lecturing confirms they'll ignore you. | Share math and mechanics. Let the facts do the persuading. |
| Disrespect parlays as "stupid" | Parlays are fun. Calling them stupid alienates the player. | "Parlays are entertainment. The math shows why they're not a long-term strategy." |
| Ignore seasonality | Sports betting is event-driven. Off-season messaging feels irrelevant. | Time content around seasons, tournaments, and major events. |
| Assume they're all the same | A casual football bettor and a sharp who tracks closing line value are very different. | Write for the middle — knowledgeable fan, variable betting sophistication. |
| Use non-sports examples | Slot machine examples don't resonate. This segment thinks in sports terms. | Use sports-specific examples: lines, spreads, totals, parlays. |
| Suggest they can't win | Some sports bettors *can* win in the short and medium term. Saying "you can't win" is dishonest. | "Beating the closing line consistently is possible but rare. Here's what the data shows." |
