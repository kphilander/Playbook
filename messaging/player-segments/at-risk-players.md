# At-Risk Players

Messaging for players showing early behavioral indicators — increased frequency, chasing losses, exceeding self-set limits. This segment is defined by behavior, not demographics or self-identification.

> **Operator note**: Players in this segment may not recognize themselves as "at risk." They likely wouldn't click on anything labeled that way. All messaging must be non-judgmental, tool-focused, and framed as normal features — never as interventions. The phrase "at-risk" itself should never appear in player-facing content. See the [Stigma-Free Language Guide](../stigma-free-language.md) for terminology.

## Segment profile

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Who** | Players whose behavior patterns have shifted — not a demographic category |
| **Defining signals** | Increased frequency, higher deposits, chasing losses, exceeding self-set limits, longer sessions, reduced breaks between sessions |
| **Self-perception** | "I'm fine. I just had a bad run." / "I'm about to turn it around." |
| **Relationship to tools** | May not have activated any tools yet, or may have adjusted limits upward |
| **Emotional state** | Frustration, determination, denial, or genuine unawareness |
| **Content receptivity** | Low for anything that feels like a warning; moderate for information framed as features |

**Important**: This segment is identified by behavioral data, not by asking the player. Players in this segment have not self-identified and may not agree they belong here. Every message must work equally well for someone who's fine and someone who isn't.

---

## Key insight

> **They may not self-identify. Messaging must be non-judgmental and tool-focused. The goal is to make features visible and easy to use — not to diagnose or label.**

The biggest risk with this segment is that well-intentioned messaging backfires. Content that says "you might have a problem" triggers defensiveness. Content that says "here's a useful feature" triggers curiosity. The job is to make the right tools available at the right moment without making the player feel watched, judged, or pathologized.

---

## Message priorities

In order of importance for this segment:

1. **Normalize tool use** — Position deposit limits, session reminders, and activity dashboards as things every player uses. Not emergency measures.
2. **Provide check-in moments** — Non-judgmental pauses that give the player a moment to decide what they want to do next. No pressure.
3. **Make limits feel like features** — "Your budget is working as designed" not "you've been restricted."
4. **Quiet accessibility** — Help resources are always visible but never the primary message. One tap away, not in their face.
5. **Activity visibility** — Make play patterns visible through dashboards and summaries so the player can self-assess without being told to.

---

## Tone guidance

**Primary archetype**: The Good Friend (Warm / Direct)

This segment gets the supportive, practical side of Playbook. Humor is minimal. The Good Friend checks in, offers tools, and steps back. No lectures, no concern, no "we noticed that" surveillance language.

| Register | When to use with this segment |
|---|---|
| **Warm / Direct** | Limit-reached moments, session check-ins, activity summaries |
| **Confident / Informative** | Tool descriptions, feature promotion, odds facts |
| **Celebratory** | When they set or maintain a limit — reinforce the positive action |
| **Playful / Witty** | Rarely. Only in educational content that happens to reach this segment. Never in triggered/behavioral messages. |

## Sample messages

### Limit reached

> "You've hit your deposit limit for this week. It resets {{RESET_DATE}}. That's your budget working as designed."

> "Weekly limit reached. It resets {{RESET_DATE}}. If you want to adjust your limit, you can do that in settings — changes take effect next period."

> "Your deposit limit is doing its job. It resets {{RESET_DATE}}. Support is always available if you want to talk: {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}"

### Session timeout

> "You've been playing for {{DURATION}}. Taking a break? Your session will be here when you get back."

> "Quick check-in: {{DURATION}} session so far. Your activity dashboard has the full picture if you want to see it."

> "Hey — {{DURATION}} mark. Your tools are one tap away. No rush, just letting you know."

### Activity summary

> "Your activity summary for {{PERIOD}} is ready. {{TOTAL_SESSIONS}} sessions, {{TOTAL_TIME}} total play time. Take a look."

> "Here's your monthly summary. Play patterns, session lengths, deposit history — all in one place."

> "Your activity dashboard has been updated. It's the clearest picture of how you play."

### Cool-off suggestion

> "Want a break? You can pause your account for 24 hours, a week, or longer. It's a feature, not a punishment."

> "Need some space? Pause your account anytime. Pick the duration that works for you."

> "Taking a break is always an option. Your account, your timeline. Pause it in settings."

### Deposit increase attempt

> "You're increasing your deposit limit. Just so you know: changes take effect after a {{COOLING_PERIOD}} cooling-off period. That's by design — it gives you time to be sure."

> "Deposit limit increase requested. It'll take effect in {{COOLING_PERIOD}}. Want to review your recent activity before then? Your dashboard has the numbers."

### Post-loss session

> "Tough session. Your activity summary has the numbers if you want to review them."

> "Every bet starts fresh with the same house edge. Chasing doesn't change the math. Your dashboard has your session breakdown."

> "Down for the session? Setting a loss limit can help manage this going forward. It's in your settings."

## Tier considerations

This segment sits at the boundary between Tier 1 (entertainment literacy) and Tier 2 (support). Here's how to navigate it:

| Principle | How to apply |
|---|---|
| **Tier 1 framing** | All behavioral messages use Tier 1 language: "features," "tools," "dashboard," "activity." Never "intervention," "harm," "risk." |
| **Tier 2 accessibility** | Help resources (helpline, chat, self-exclusion) are always visible — in the footer, in settings, at the bottom of activity summaries. Present but not prominent. |
| **Never label** | The phrase "at-risk" never appears in player-facing content. Neither does "problem," "concern," "warning," or "we noticed." |
| **Never diagnose** | Don't tell the player what their behavior means. Show them the data (activity summary) and let them draw their own conclusions. |
| **Cooling-off over cutoff** | When a player hits a limit, frame it as the tool working correctly — not as a restriction imposed on them. |

---

## What to avoid

| Don't | Why | Do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Use the phrase "at-risk" | Clinical label. Players don't self-identify this way and will reject the message. | Describe the situation, not the person. "Your limit is reached" not "You're at risk." |
| Say "we noticed your behavior" | Surveillance framing. Makes the player feel watched and judged. | "Your activity summary is ready." Let the data speak. |
| Use clinical language | "Gambling behavior," "intervention," "harm reduction" — all signal that something is wrong. | "Play patterns," "features," "your tools." |
| Label or diagnose | "You might have a problem" will be met with denial and disengagement. | "Here are your tools. They're here whenever you want them." |
| Add shame | "This is your third limit increase this month" — counting and calling out creates shame. | "Limit increase requested. Changes take effect in {{COOLING_PERIOD}}." |
| Use humor in triggered messages | A limit-reached notification is not the time for wit. | Warm, direct, factual. The Good Friend reads the room. |
| Make help the primary CTA | If "Get help" is the main button, the player feels cornered. | Make it secondary. Primary CTA is the tool action; help is visible but not prominent. |
| Use "you" accusatively | "You exceeded your limit" assigns blame. | "Your limit has been reached" is factual without pointing fingers. |
