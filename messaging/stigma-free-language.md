# Stigma-Free Language Guide

Person-first language reference for all {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content. 35 terms with preferred alternatives, rationale, and examples in context. This guide ensures that every piece of Playbook messaging respects players, avoids pathologizing, and stays true to the brand voice.

> **Operator note**: Tier 1 content (entertainment literacy) follows these guidelines strictly. Tier 2 content (clinical support, regulatory filings) may use clinical terms where accuracy requires it — but always with person-first framing. When in doubt, use this guide. See [Chapter 4: Voice and Tone](../brand-book/04-voice-and-tone.md#language-guide) for the full language framework.

## The person-first principle

Person-first language puts the individual before the condition, behavior, or label. It's the foundation of respectful communication in any health-adjacent field, and it's essential for {{PROGRAM_NAME}}.

### Why it matters for Playbook

1. **Labels shut people down.** A player who reads "problem gambler" and doesn't self-identify will dismiss the entire message as "not for me." A player who *does* self-identify may feel shame — and shame drives avoidance, not engagement.

2. **Language shapes perception.** "Gambling addict" reduces a person to a condition. "Person experiencing difficulty with gambling" acknowledges the difficulty without defining the person by it.

3. **Tier 1 doesn't diagnose.** Playbook Tier 1 content is entertainment literacy. It's for everyone. The moment you use clinical or diagnostic language, you've moved into Tier 2 territory — and you've lost most of your audience.

### Examples

| Instead of | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "Gambling addicts need help." | "People experiencing difficulty with gambling can access free support." | The person is not their condition. |
| "Problem gamblers often chase losses." | "Players sometimes chase losses — here's why the math doesn't support it." | Universal framing (everyone might do this) rather than diagnostic labeling. |
| "At-risk populations should use tools." | "These tools are available to every player." | Don't create categories of people. Offer tools to everyone. |

## Term-by-term guide

### Clinical / pathological terms

Terms that belong in medical or regulatory contexts, not in player-facing Tier 1 content.

| # | Term to avoid | Preferred alternative | Why | Example in context |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Problem gambler | Player / person | "Problem gambler" defines someone by a clinical label. "Player" is neutral and inclusive. | **Avoid**: "Problem gamblers should seek help." **Use**: "Support is available for any player — for any question about gambling." |
| 2 | Gambling addiction | Difficulty with gambling | "Addiction" is a clinical diagnosis. Use it in Tier 2 clinical contexts only. | **Avoid**: "Signs of gambling addiction." **Use**: "If gambling doesn't feel fun anymore, support is available." |
| 3 | Pathological gambling | Difficulty with gambling | Outdated clinical term. Removed from DSM-5 in favor of "gambling disorder." Don't use either in Tier 1. | **Avoid**: "Pathological gambling behaviors." **Use**: "Play patterns that might concern you." |
| 4 | Gambling disorder | Difficulty with gambling | Clinical diagnosis (DSM-5). Appropriate in clinical/regulatory contexts. Not for Tier 1. | **Avoid**: "You may have a gambling disorder." **Use**: "Curious about your play patterns? Check your dashboard." |
| 5 | Compulsive gambling | Repeated patterns / difficulty stopping | "Compulsive" implies the person has lost control. | **Avoid**: "Compulsive gambling warning signs." **Use**: "Patterns worth noticing in your play." |
| 6 | Disordered gambling | — | Clinical category. Use in Tier 2 only. | **Avoid**: "If you exhibit disordered gambling." **Use**: "If gambling doesn't feel fun anymore." |

### Judgmental language

Terms that carry implicit moral judgment about how people spend their time and money.

| # | Term to avoid | Preferred alternative | Why | Example in context |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 7 | Gambler | Player | "Gambler" carries negative connotations. "Player" is neutral. | **Avoid**: "Gamblers should know the odds." **Use**: "Players who know the odds enjoy the game more." |
| 8 | Irresponsible gambling | — (don't use the frame) | Implies moral failure. Playbook doesn't judge how people play. | **Avoid**: "Irresponsible gambling leads to problems." **Use**: "Setting a budget before you play makes every session better." |
| 9 | Reckless betting | — (don't use the frame) | Moral judgment on behavior. | **Avoid**: "Avoid reckless betting." **Use**: "Here's how to set a budget that works for you." |
| 10 | Wasting money | Entertainment spending / play costs | Judging how someone spends money is not Playbook's job. | **Avoid**: "Don't waste money on gambling." **Use**: "Know the cost of play before you start." |
| 11 | Losing control | — (describe the specific behavior instead) | Implies the person is out of control. Describe what's happening without labeling. | **Avoid**: "Signs you're losing control." **Use**: "If you're spending more than you planned, your deposit limit can help." |
| 12 | Bad habits | Play patterns | "Bad" is a judgment. Patterns are neutral and observable. | **Avoid**: "Break your bad gambling habits." **Use**: "Review your play patterns in your dashboard." |

### Paternalistic framing

Terms that position the brand as parent, teacher, or authority figure.

| # | Term to avoid | Preferred alternative | Why | Example in context |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 13 | Responsible gambling | Specific behaviors (e.g., "set a budget," "know the odds") | Generic label. Doesn't drive action. Implies irresponsibility. | **Avoid**: "Practice responsible gambling." **Use**: "Set your budget. Know the odds. Check your session." |
| 14 | Smart play / Play smart | Specific behaviors | Same issue as "responsible gambling" — generic, slightly condescending. | **Avoid**: "Play smart this weekend." **Use**: "Know the house edge before you sit down." |
| 15 | You should | You can / Consider / Here's an option | "Should" is prescriptive. Playbook offers; it doesn't instruct. | **Avoid**: "You should set a deposit limit." **Use**: "Set your deposit limit. It takes 10 seconds." |
| 16 | We recommend | Here's what's available / An option | Sounds like a prescription. Let the player decide. | **Avoid**: "We recommend setting a session limit." **Use**: "Session limits are available in your settings." |
| 17 | You need to | You can | "Need to" implies obligation. "Can" implies option. | **Avoid**: "You need to set a budget." **Use**: "You can set your budget in settings." |
| 18 | For your own good | — (just state the benefit) | Paternalistic. The player can judge what's good for them. | **Avoid**: "Set limits for your own good." **Use**: "Set limits and play without second-guessing." |

### Industry jargon

Terms that are clear to regulators and researchers but meaningless or off-putting to players.

| # | Term to avoid | Preferred alternative | Why | Example in context |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 19 | Intervention | Feature / tool | "Intervention" implies something done *to* you. "Feature" implies something done *for* you. | **Avoid**: "This intervention helps reduce harm." **Use**: "This feature helps you track your spending." |
| 20 | Harm minimization | — (describe the specific benefit) | Public health jargon. Players don't think in terms of "harm." | **Avoid**: "A harm-minimization tool." **Use**: "A tool that keeps your spending on track." |
| 21 | Self-exclude (in Tier 1) | Take a break / Pause your account | "Exclude" sounds punitive. "Break" and "pause" sound voluntary. Use "self-exclusion" in Tier 2 formal contexts. | **Avoid**: "Self-exclude from this platform." **Use**: "Take a break. Pause your account for as long as you need." |
| 22 | Mandatory responsible gambling message | Required information / Here's what you should know | Don't announce that a message is mandatory. Just deliver the message well. | **Avoid**: "The following responsible gambling message is provided as required by law." **Use**: Just deliver the message in Playbook voice. |
| 23 | Restrictions | Limits / your limits | "Restrictions" implies external control. "Limits" implies ownership. | **Avoid**: "Your account restrictions." **Use**: "Your limits. Your call." |
| 24 | Self-assess | Check in / Review your play | "Self-assess" sounds clinical. "Check in" is casual and inviting. | **Avoid**: "Self-assess your gambling behavior." **Use**: "Check in on your play patterns." |
| 25 | Reality check | Session reminder | "Reality check" implies the player has lost touch with reality. | **Avoid**: "Set a reality check reminder." **Use**: "Set a session reminder." |
| 26 | Wagering behavior | Play patterns / activity | Clinical abstraction. Use everyday language. | **Avoid**: "Monitor your wagering behavior." **Use**: "Review your play activity." |

### Fear-based language

Terms designed to scare rather than inform.

| # | Term to avoid | Preferred alternative | Why | Example in context |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 27 | Harm | — (describe the specific concern or benefit) | "Harm" is Tier 2. In Tier 1, focus on what players gain, not what they avoid. | **Avoid**: "Reduce gambling-related harm." **Use**: "Play on your terms with the right tools." |
| 28 | Danger / Dangerous | — (state the fact instead) | Fear word. Let facts speak for themselves. | **Avoid**: "Gambling can be dangerous." **Use**: "Every game has a house edge. Here's what that means." |
| 29 | Warning / WARNING | Heads up / Here's what you should know | "Warning" triggers avoidance. "Heads up" triggers attention. | **Avoid**: "WARNING: You have been playing for 2 hours." **Use**: "Heads up: you've been playing for 2 hours." |
| 30 | Risk / At-risk | — (describe the specific situation) | Clinical category. Don't label players. Describe behaviors. | **Avoid**: "At-risk players should use tools." **Use**: "These tools are available to every player." |
| 31 | Consequences | Costs / what to know | "Consequences" implies punishment. "Costs" is neutral. | **Avoid**: "Be aware of the consequences of gambling." **Use**: "Know the cost of play before you start." |
| 32 | Odds are against you / Stacked against you | The house has an edge / Here's the house edge | Same fact, different framing. One is threatening, the other is informative. | **Avoid**: "The odds are stacked against you." **Use**: "The house edge on this game is 5.26%." |
| 33 | Lose / You will lose | Play costs / The house edge means... | Deficit-focused. Reframe as cost of entertainment. | **Avoid**: "Over time, you will lose money." **Use**: "Over time, the house edge means the game returns less than you put in. That's the cost of play." |
| 34 | Destroy / Ruin | — (don't catastrophize) | Catastrophizing drives avoidance, not engagement. | **Avoid**: "Don't let gambling ruin your life." **Use**: "Support is available for any question about gambling. {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}" |
| 35 | Victim | Person experiencing difficulty | "Victim" removes agency. Person-first language preserves it. | **Avoid**: "Victims of gambling addiction." **Use**: "People experiencing difficulty with gambling." |

## Context-dependent terms

Some terms are appropriate in Tier 2 (clinical, regulatory, formal) but wrong in Tier 1 (entertainment literacy, player-facing). Know the boundary.

| Term | Tier 1 (player-facing) | Tier 2 (clinical/regulatory) |
|---|---|---|
| Self-exclusion | "Take a break" / "Pause your account" | "Self-exclusion" is acceptable in formal documentation |
| Gambling disorder | Don't use | Acceptable in clinical referral content |
| Problem gambling | Don't use as a label | Acceptable when describing a recognized clinical concept |
| Treatment | "Support" / "Help" | Acceptable in clinical referral content |
| Intervention | "Feature" / "Tool" | Acceptable in regulatory filings |
| At-risk | Don't use as a player label | Acceptable in internal analytics and clinical assessments |
| Harm | Don't use | Acceptable in regulatory and public health contexts |
| Addiction | Don't use | Acceptable in Tier 2 clinical content with person-first framing |
| Relapse | "Return to play" (if needed) | Acceptable in clinical support contexts |
| Recovery | "Moving forward" / "Next steps" | Acceptable in Tier 2 support content |

## Testing checklist

Use this checklist to audit existing copy for stigmatizing language. Run it on any content before it goes live.

### The 8-point stigma audit

1. **Person-first check**: Does the copy define anyone by a condition? ("Problem gambler" defines. "Player experiencing difficulty" describes.)

2. **Label scan**: Search for: "problem gambler," "addict," "compulsive," "pathological," "disordered," "at-risk," "victim." Replace with person-first alternatives.

3. **Judgment check**: Does the copy imply moral failure? ("Irresponsible," "reckless," "wasting money.") Replace with neutral descriptions.

4. **Fear check**: Does the copy use scare tactics? ("WARNING," "danger," "destroy," "ruin.") Replace with factual statements.

5. **Jargon scan**: Search for: "intervention," "harm minimization," "self-exclude" (in Tier 1), "reality check," "wagering behavior." Replace with plain-language alternatives.

6. **Paternalism check**: Does the copy tell players what they *should* do? ("You should," "We recommend," "For your own good.") Reframe as options and information.

7. **Agency check**: Does the player have choice? ("Your account has been restricted" removes agency. "You've hit your limit" preserves it.)

8. **Read-aloud test**: Read the copy aloud. Does it sound like a friend talking? Or does it sound like a doctor, a lawyer, or a parent? If the latter, rewrite.

### How to use this checklist

- **New content**: Run all 8 checks before publication.
- **Existing content**: Prioritize checks 1, 2, and 4 (labels, clinical terms, fear language) — these cause the most harm.
- **Quarterly audit**: Review all live copy against the full checklist once per quarter.
- **Training**: Use the [before/after pairs](tone-examples.md) as training material for content teams.
