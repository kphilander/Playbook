# Calls to Action

Comprehensive CTA reference organized by what you want the player to do. Every CTA includes label text, maximum character count, context, tone register, and recommended tagline pairings.

> **Operator note**: CTAs should feel like features, not mandates. "Set your limits" is an invitation. "You must set limits" is a command. Playbook always invites. Adapt label text to your platform's UI conventions, but keep the tone conversational and specific.

## CTA format guide

### Button vs link vs inline

| Format | When to use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary button** | One clear action per screen. The thing you most want the player to do. | `[Set your limits]` on the deposit screen |
| **Secondary button** | Supporting action. Available but not the main focus. | `[Learn more]` next to a feature description |
| **Text link** | Inline within body copy. Context-dependent. | "See how the [odds comparison tool] works." |
| **Inline CTA** | Within a paragraph or notification. Conversational. | "Your stats are ready. Take a look." |

### Urgency spectrum

CTAs exist on a spectrum from soft nudge to strong prompt. Match the urgency to the context.

| Level | Tone | When to use | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Soft nudge** | Curious, low-pressure | Awareness, education, first exposure | "See how it works" / "Learn more" |
| **Confident invite** | Self-assured, direct | Feature promotion, returning players | "Set your limits" / "Take the quiz" |
| **Warm prompt** | Supportive, clear | Limit-reached, session reminders | "Check your activity" / "Review your session" |
| **Strong prompt** | Direct, no-nonsense | Help-seeking, Tier 2 crossover | "Talk to someone now" / "Call {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}" |

## A/B testing guidance

Not sure which CTA will perform best? Test these recommended variants.

### High-priority tests

| Test | Variant A | Variant B | Hypothesis |
|---|---|---|---|
| Quiz entry | "Take the quiz" | "Test your game IQ" | Longer, more specific CTA may increase click-through |
| Limit setting | "Set your limits" | "Set your budget" | "Budget" may feel more natural than "limits" |
| Dashboard | "Check your stats" | "See your activity" | "Stats" is more casual; "activity" is more neutral |
| Sharing | "Share this" | "Send to a friend" | Personal framing may increase share rate |
| Help access | "Find support" | "Talk to someone" | Person-focused CTA may reduce friction |

### Testing rules

1. **Test one variable at a time.** Don't change the CTA text *and* the button color *and* the placement simultaneously.
2. **Run for a full cycle.** Minimum 2 weeks or 1,000 impressions per variant, whichever comes first.
3. **Measure action, not clicks.** The goal is whether the player completes the intended action (sets a limit, finishes the quiz), not just whether they click.
4. **Document results.** Add winning variants back to this file for the team.

---

## Accessibility

CTA text must work for all players, including those using screen readers.

### Rules

1. **No "click here."** Screen readers announce links out of context. "Click here" tells the player nothing. "Set your limits" tells them exactly what happens.
2. **No "learn more" without context.** If "Learn more" is the only link text, add a visually hidden label: `<a href="...">Learn more <span class="sr-only">about deposit limits</span></a>`.
3. **Verb-first.** Start every CTA with an action verb: "Set," "Take," "See," "Check," "Share."
4. **Describe the destination.** The player should know what happens before they tap. "See the real odds" is better than "Go."
5. **Sufficient contrast.** CTA buttons must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text). See `_brand.yml` for configured color pairings.
6. **Touch target size.** Minimum 44x44px for all interactive CTA elements (WCAG 2.1 Level AA).

### Screen reader examples

| Visual CTA | Screen reader announcement |
|---|---|
| "Take the quiz" | "Take the quiz, link" |
| "Set your limits" | "Set your limits, button" |
| "Share this" | "Share this article about house edge, link" (with `aria-label`) |
| "Learn more" | "Learn more about deposit limits, link" (with `sr-only` text) |
