# Blackjack — Quick Reference

## How it works
Get closer to `21` than the dealer without going over. You choose: hit, stand, double, or split. The dealer follows a fixed script — hit below 17, stand at 17 or above. Your decisions genuinely affect the outcome.

## The key numbers
- **House edge:** `0.5%` (with basic strategy) to `2%+` (without)
- **Best payout:** `3:2` on a natural blackjack — avoid `6:5` tables
- **Dealer bust rate:** about `28%`

## One thing to know
Basic strategy takes 20 minutes to learn and cuts the house edge in half. It's the mathematically optimal decision for every hand. Free charts are available everywhere.

## The math in plain English
With basic strategy, for every `$100` you bet over time, you'd lose about `50 cents` on average — the best odds in the casino. Without basic strategy, that climbs to `$2–$2.50`.
