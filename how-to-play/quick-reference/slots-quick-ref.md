# Slots — Quick Reference

## How it works
You press spin. A random number generator (RNG) picks the result instantly. The reels are just the animation. Every spin is independent — no patterns, no memory, no hot streaks.

## The key numbers
- **House edge:** `2–15%`
- **RTP:** `85–98%` (set in software, verified by regulators)
- **Volatility:** Low (frequent small wins) → High (rare big wins)

## One thing to know
Check the paytable before you play. It shows the RTP, paylines, and bonus triggers. Takes 30 seconds. Tells you everything the machine won't.

## The math in plain English
For every `$100` you bet over time on a machine with `95%` RTP, you'd lose about `$5` on average. Any single session can go either way.
