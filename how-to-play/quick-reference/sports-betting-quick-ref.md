# Sports Betting — Quick Reference

## How it works
You bet on the outcome of sporting events. The sportsbook sets the odds, building in a margin (the vig) on every line. If you win, you get paid based on the odds. If you lose, you lose your stake.

## The key numbers
- **Standard vig:** `~4.5%` (at −110 odds)
- **Break-even win rate:** `52.4%` (at −110)
- **10-leg parlay odds:** about `1 in 1,024`

## One thing to know
At standard −110 odds, you need to win `52.4%` of your bets just to break even. The vig means winning half your bets isn't enough. Professional bettors consider a 55% win rate excellent.

## The math in plain English
For every `$110` you bet at standard odds, you win `$100` on a win and lose `$110` on a loss. The `$10` gap is the vig — the sportsbook's commission. Parlays compound the vig with every leg you add.
