# Roulette — Quick Reference

## How it works
A ball lands on a random number on a spinning wheel. You win if you bet on that number or a group containing it. Pure chance — no decision changes the odds. The only choice that matters: which wheel you play.

## The key numbers
- **European (single zero):** `2.70%` house edge
- **American (double zero):** `5.26%` house edge
- **French (la partage):** `1.35%` on even-money bets

## One thing to know
One zero or two — that's the biggest decision. European roulette has half the house edge of American. Same game, same bets, different math. Check the wheel before you play.

## The math in plain English
On a European wheel, for every `$100` you bet over time, you'd lose about `$2.70`. On an American wheel, that's `$5.26` — nearly double, because of one extra green pocket.
