# How to Play: Roulette

Everything you need to know about roulette — the wheel, the bets, and why the number of zeros changes everything. No fine print.

> **Operator note**: House edge figures assume standard rules. Some tables offer French rules (la partage, en prison) that reduce the edge on even-money bets. Verify the specific rules and payouts on your tables before deploying. All copy follows {{PROGRAM_NAME}} Tier 1 voice (The Sharp).

## The 30-second version

> Roulette is pure chance. A ball lands on a random number, and you win if you bet on that number (or a group containing it). No decision you make changes the odds. The only decision that matters is which wheel you play: European (one zero, `2.70%` house edge) or American (two zeros, `5.26%` house edge). That single zero nearly doubles the house's advantage.

## How the game works

### The wheel

A roulette wheel has numbered pockets where a ball can land. The numbers are `1` through `36`, alternating red and black, plus one or two green zeros:

| Wheel type | Pockets | Zeros | Numbers |
|-----------|---------|-------|---------|
| **European** | `37` | Single zero (`0`) | `0–36` |
| **American** | `38` | Double zero (`0`, `00`) | `0`, `00`, `1–36` |
| **French** | `37` | Single zero with la partage/en prison rules | `0–36` |

The green zero(s) are what give the house its edge. Without them, every bet would be perfectly fair.

### Playing a round

1. **Place your bets.** Put your chips on the table layout — on numbers, groups of numbers, colors, or other options. You can place multiple bets at once.
2. **The dealer spins the wheel** and launches the ball in the opposite direction.
3. **"No more bets."** The dealer calls this when the ball is about to drop. After this, no chips can be placed or moved.
4. **The ball lands.** It settles into a numbered pocket. That number and its color are the result.
5. **Payouts.** The dealer clears losing bets and pays winners. Payouts depend on the type of bet (see below).
6. **Next round.** Place your bets again.

Every spin is independent. The wheel doesn't remember previous results. The electronic boards showing "hot" and "cold" numbers are for entertainment — they have zero predictive value.

## Bet types

### Inside bets

Bets placed directly on specific numbers. Higher risk, higher payout.

| Bet | What it means | Payout | Numbers covered |
|-----|--------------|--------|----------------|
| **Straight up** | A single number | `35:1` | `1` |
| **Split** | Two adjacent numbers | `17:1` | `2` |
| **Street** | Three numbers in a row | `11:1` | `3` |
| **Corner** | Four numbers that share a corner | `8:1` | `4` |
| **Six line** | Two adjacent rows (six numbers) | `5:1` | `6` |

### Outside bets

Bets placed on larger groups. Lower risk, lower payout.

| Bet | What it means | Payout | Numbers covered |
|-----|--------------|--------|----------------|
| **Red / Black** | The winning number's color | `1:1` | `18` |
| **Odd / Even** | Whether the winning number is odd or even | `1:1` | `18` |
| **High / Low** | `1–18` (low) or `19–36` (high) | `1:1` | `18` |
| **Dozens** | First 12 (`1–12`), second 12 (`13–24`), or third 12 (`25–36`) | `2:1` | `12` |
| **Columns** | One of three vertical columns on the layout | `2:1` | `12` |

**Key point:** Every bet on a standard roulette table has the same house edge — whether you bet on a single number or red/black. The payouts are calibrated so the house edge is consistent across all bets. The only exception: the five-number bet (`0`, `00`, `1`, `2`, `3`) on American roulette, which has a higher edge of `7.89%`. Avoid it.

## The math

### House edge by wheel type

| Wheel | House edge | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| **European** (single zero) | `2.70%` | 37 pockets, payouts based on 36. The zero is the house's margin. |
| **American** (double zero) | `5.26%` | 38 pockets, payouts still based on 36. Two zeros = nearly double the edge. |
| **French** (with la partage) | `1.35%` on even-money bets | If the ball lands on zero, you get half your even-money bet back. |

### How the house edge works

Take a straight-up bet on European roulette. You pick one number out of `37` possible pockets. Your chance of winning is `1 in 37` (about `2.70%`). But the payout is `35:1` — as if there were only 36 pockets. That gap between the real odds (`1 in 37`) and the payout odds (`35:1`) is the house edge.

On American roulette, it's `1 in 38` with the same `35:1` payout. The gap is wider. The house keeps more.

### What this means for your wallet

On a European wheel with a `2.70%` house edge: for every `$100` you bet over time, you'd lose about `$2.70` on average.

On an American wheel at `5.26%`: that same `$100` costs you about `$5.26` over time.

That's nearly double — for the same game, the same bets, the same experience. The only difference is one extra green pocket.

## Key terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Inside bet** | A bet placed on specific numbers on the inside of the table layout. Higher payouts, lower probability. |
| **Outside bet** | A bet placed on large groups (red/black, odd/even, dozens) on the outside of the layout. Lower payouts, higher probability. |
| **Straight up** | A bet on a single number. Pays `35:1`. |
| **Zero (0)** | The green pocket that gives the house its edge. European wheels have one. |
| **Double zero (00)** | The second green pocket on American wheels. Nearly doubles the house edge. |
| **La partage** | A French roulette rule: if the ball lands on zero, even-money bets lose only half. Cuts the house edge to `1.35%`. |
| **En prison** | A French roulette rule: if the ball lands on zero, even-money bets are "imprisoned" — held for the next spin. If your bet wins on the next spin, you get it back (but no winnings). Effectively the same edge reduction as la partage. |
| **Croupier** | The dealer at a roulette table. Spins the wheel, calls the result, handles bets and payouts. |

## Tips for informed play

1. **Check the wheel type before you play.** European (one zero) has a `2.70%` edge. American (two zeros) has `5.26%`. If both are available, the math favors European. Every time.
2. **Look for la partage or en prison rules.** If a table offers French rules on even-money bets, the house edge drops to `1.35%` — the lowest in roulette.
3. **Know that every spin is independent.** The ball landed on red five times in a row? The odds on the next spin are exactly the same. Electronic scoreboards showing past results are entertainment, not information.
4. **Skip the five-number bet on American roulette.** The bet covering `0`, `00`, `1`, `2`, `3` carries a `7.89%` house edge — the worst bet on the table.
5. **Set your budget per session.** Roulette moves at a moderate pace (about 30–40 spins per hour at a physical table, faster online). Decide what your session is worth as entertainment before you start.

## Quiz questions

### Question 1

**Stem:** What's the main difference between European and American roulette?

| Option | Text |
|--------|------|
| A | American roulette has more numbers on the wheel |
| B | American roulette has a double zero, nearly doubling the house edge |
| C | European roulette spins faster |
| D | American roulette uses a different color scheme |

**Correct:** B

**Explanation:** European roulette has 37 pockets (numbers 1–36 plus a single zero). American roulette has 38 pockets — adding a double zero (00). Both pay out at the same rates, but the extra pocket means the house edge jumps from 2.70% to 5.26%. Same game, same payouts, different odds — because of one extra green pocket.

**Source:** Standard roulette probability: house edge = zeros / total pockets × 100.

---

### Question 2

**Stem:** You're at a roulette table and the ball has landed on black 8 times in a row. What are the odds it lands on red next?

| Option | Text |
|--------|------|
| A | Higher than normal — red is "due" |
| B | Lower than normal — the wheel is on a black streak |
| C | Exactly the same as any other spin |
| D | 50/50 — red and black are equally likely |

**Correct:** C

**Explanation:** Each spin is independent. The ball doesn't know what happened before. On a European wheel, the odds of red on any spin are 18/37 (about 48.6%) — not 50/50, because the green zero exists. Those odds are exactly the same whether the last 8 spins were black, red, or alternating. The idea that red is "due" is the gambler's fallacy.

### Question 3

**Stem:** Which roulette bet has a different house edge than all the others?

| Option | Text |
|--------|------|
| A | Straight up (single number) |
| B | Red or black |
| C | The five-number bet (0, 00, 1, 2, 3) on American roulette |
| D | Dozens |

**Correct:** C

**Explanation:** On a standard roulette table, every bet has the same house edge — 2.70% on European, 5.26% on American. The lone exception is the five-number bet (0, 00, 1, 2, 3) on American roulette, which carries a 7.89% house edge. It's the worst bet on the table. Every other bet — whether you're picking a single number or betting on colors — has the same proportional house advantage.

**Source:** Five-number bet edge: 5/38 = 7.89%, vs. standard American edge of 2/38 = 5.26%.
