![Slots — How It Works](../collateral/render/htp-card-slots.png)

---

## The 30-second version

> Slots are pure chance. You press a button, a random number generator picks the outcome, and the reels display the result. There's no strategy that changes the math. The house edge ranges from `2%` to `15%` depending on the machine. Check the paytable before you play — it takes 30 seconds and tells you everything the machine won't.

---

## How the game works

### The basics

Every modern slot machine — whether it's a physical cabinet in a casino or a game on your phone — runs on a **random number generator (RNG)**. The RNG produces a random result the instant you hit spin. The spinning reels are just the show.

### Playing a spin

1. **Choose your bet.** You set two things: how many paylines to activate (some machines let you choose; others fix all lines) and how much to bet per line. Your total bet = lines × bet per line.
2. **Press spin.** The RNG generates a random number. That number maps to a specific combination of symbols on the reels.
3. **Reels display the result.** The animation plays out, but the outcome was already decided before the reels started moving.
4. **Wins are paid automatically.** If the symbols on an active payline match a winning combination listed in the paytable, you get paid. If not, the bet is lost.

### Bonus features

Many modern slots include bonus mechanics that trigger under specific conditions:

- **Free spins** — land a certain number of scatter symbols and you get extra spins at no cost. The game still uses the same RNG.
- **Bonus rounds** — a separate screen with a pick-a-prize or wheel-spin mechanic. Still RNG. Still random.
- **Progressive jackpots** — a small percentage of every bet goes into a shared prize pool. The jackpot grows until someone wins it. The odds of hitting a progressive are typically between `1 in 1 million` and `1 in 50 million`.

## Bet types

Slots don't have bet types the way table games do. What you control is the **size** of your bet.

| Setting | What it means | What it affects |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Bet per line** | The amount wagered on each active payline | Win size — payouts are multiplied by your bet per line |
| **Number of lines** | How many paylines are active this spin | Win frequency — more lines means more chances to match, but higher total bet |
| **Max bet** | Activates all paylines at maximum bet per line | Required for some progressive jackpots — check the paytable |
<!-- ADAPT: currency -->
| **Coin denomination** | The base value of each credit (e.g., $0.01, $0.25, $1.00) | Sets the scale of everything — bets, wins, and losses |
<!-- /ADAPT -->

<!-- ADAPT: currency -->
**Key point:** Betting more per spin does not improve your odds. The house edge is a percentage — it applies equally whether you bet `$0.25` or `$25`. Bigger bets mean bigger potential wins *and* bigger potential losses at the same rate.
<!-- /ADAPT -->

## The math

![RTP and volatility compared across slot machine types](diagrams/slots-rtp-volatility.svg)

### House edge and RTP

Every slot machine has a programmed **return to player (RTP)** — the percentage of all money wagered that the machine pays back to players over its lifetime. The **house edge** is what's left over.

| Metric | Typical range | What it means |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
<!-- ADAPT: currency -->
| **RTP** | `85–98%` | For every `$100` wagered in total, the machine pays back `$85` to `$98` |
| **House edge** | `2–15%` | The casino's cut — what the machine keeps |
<!-- /ADAPT -->

Most online slots sit in the `92–97%` RTP range. Physical casino machines tend to run `85–95%`. These numbers are set in the game software and regulated by gaming authorities.

### What this means for your wallet

<!-- ADAPT: currency -->
A slot with `95%` RTP has a `5%` house edge. For every `$100` you bet over time, you'd lose about `$5` on average. That's the long-run math — any single session can swing wildly in either direction.
<!-- /ADAPT -->

### Volatility

RTP tells you the long-run average. **Volatility** tells you what the ride feels like.

| Volatility | What it means | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Low** | Frequent small wins, fewer dry spells | Steady — your balance changes slowly |
| **Medium** | Mix of small and medium wins | Balanced — some swings, some stability |
| **High** | Rare but larger wins, longer losing streaks | Roller coaster — long droughts punctuated by big hits |

Two machines can have the same `95%` RTP but play completely differently. A low-volatility machine pays out often in small amounts. A high-volatility machine might eat your budget for 50 spins and then pay a large win. Same math, different experience.

## Key terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **RNG** (random number generator) | The software that produces a random outcome for every spin. It runs continuously, even when nobody is playing. See [glossary](../brand-book/glossary.md#rng). |
| **RTP** (return to player) | The percentage of total money wagered that a machine pays back over its lifetime. `95%` RTP means a `5%` house edge. See [glossary](../brand-book/glossary.md#rtp). |
| **Payline** | A line across the reels where matching symbols must land to count as a win. Modern slots can have `1` to `1,000+` paylines. |
| **Paytable** | The chart that shows every winning combination and its payout. Usually accessible via an info button on the machine. |
| **Scatter** | A special symbol that triggers a bonus (usually free spins) regardless of its position on the reels — it doesn't need to land on a payline. |
| **Wild** | A symbol that substitutes for other symbols to complete winning combinations. Works like a joker in cards. |
| **Volatility** | How a slot's payouts are distributed. Low volatility = frequent small wins. High volatility = rare big wins. Also called variance. See [glossary](../brand-book/glossary.md#volatility). |
| **Progressive jackpot** | A prize pool that grows with every bet placed across linked machines. Resets to a base amount after someone wins. |
| **Free spins** | Extra spins awarded during play, usually triggered by landing scatter symbols. You don't pay for these spins, but the game's RNG still determines results. |
| **Multiplier** | A feature that multiplies your win by a set factor (e.g., 2x, 5x, 10x). Appears in base games and bonus rounds. |

## Tips for informed play

1. **Check the paytable before you play.** It takes 30 seconds. You'll see the RTP, payline structure, and what triggers bonuses. If a machine doesn't show its RTP, that's worth knowing too.
2. **Understand what "max bet required" means.** Some progressive jackpots only pay if you're betting the maximum. If you're not going to max bet, you may want a non-progressive machine where every bet has the same proportional chance.
3. **Pick your volatility, not your theme.** Two machines with cartoon themes can play completely differently. Low volatility stretches your session. High volatility creates bigger swings. Neither is better — they're different experiences.
<!-- ADAPT: currency, framing -->
4. **Set your budget before you press spin.** Decide what you're willing to spend for the session and stick to it. Slots move fast — a `$0.50` bet every 3 seconds adds up to `$600` per hour.
<!-- /ADAPT -->
5. **Know that every spin is independent.** What happened on the last spin — or the last 1,000 spins — has zero effect on the next one. The RNG doesn't keep score.

## Quiz questions

### Question 1

**Stem:** What determines the outcome of a slot machine spin?

| Option | Text |
|--------|------|
| A | The number of previous losses since the last win |
| B | A random number generator (RNG) that produces a result the instant you press spin |
| C | The time of day you're playing |
| D | How much you bet on that spin |

**Correct:** B

**Explanation:** Every spin is determined by a random number generator. The RNG produces a result the instant you press the button — before the reels even start moving. Previous results, time of day, and bet size have no effect on the outcome. The reels are just an animation displaying a decision that was already made.

**Source:** Gaming regulators require certified RNG software in all licensed slot machines.

---

### Question 2

**Stem:** A slot machine has a 95% RTP (return to player). What does that mean?

| Option | Text |
|--------|------|
| A | You'll win 95% of your spins |
| B | The machine pays back 95% of all money wagered over its lifetime |
| C | You'll walk away with 95% of your starting money |
| D | 95% of players who use this machine will win |

**Correct:** B

**Explanation:** RTP is a long-run average across all players and all bets on that machine. A 95% RTP means the machine keeps about 5% (the house edge) and pays back 95% — but that's across millions of spins. In a single session, you could win big, lose everything, or land anywhere in between. RTP doesn't predict what will happen to you today.

**Source:** RTP is programmed into the game software and verified by independent testing labs.

---

### Question 3

**Stem:** You've been playing a slot machine for 30 minutes without a win. What are the odds of winning on the next spin?

| Option | Text |
|--------|------|
| A | Higher than when you started — the machine is "due" |
| B | Lower than when you started — the machine is in a cold phase |
| C | Exactly the same as every other spin |
| D | It depends on how much you bet |

**Correct:** C

**Explanation:** Every spin is independent. The RNG doesn't track how long you've been playing or how much you've lost. A machine that hasn't paid out in 30 minutes has exactly the same odds on the next spin as a machine that just hit a jackpot. The concept of being "due" for a win is the gambler's fallacy — one of the most common misconceptions in gambling.
