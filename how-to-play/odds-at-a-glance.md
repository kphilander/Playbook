# Odds at a Glance

> **Operator note**: These are general industry figures. Actual house edge and RTP vary by game variant, paytable, bet type, and jurisdiction. Verify against your specific products. All copy follows {{PROGRAM_NAME}} Tier 1 voice (Sam).

## How to read this table

**House edge** is the percentage the house expects to keep from every dollar wagered over the long run. A `5%` house edge means for every `$100` you bet over time, you'd lose about `$5` on average.

**RTP** (return to player) is the flip side: `100%` minus the house edge. A game with a `5%` edge has a `95%` RTP.

**"Best bet"** is the single bet within each game that gives the house the smallest advantage — assuming optimal play where applicable.

**"Typical range"** reflects the spread from the best available bet to the worst common bet within that game. A wider range means your bet choice matters more.

**"What determines outcome"** tells you whether skill (your decisions) affects the result, or whether it's pure chance. In skill + chance games, good decisions shrink the house edge. In pure chance games, no decision changes the math.

## What this means

- The house edge applies **over time, across many bets**. Any single session can go either way.
- A lower house edge doesn't mean you'll win. It means you'll lose less per dollar bet in the long run.
- **Games with a skill component** (blackjack, video poker, poker, sports betting) let you reduce the house edge by making better decisions. The "best bet" column assumes you're making optimal choices.
- **Games of pure chance** (slots, roulette, bingo, lottery) have a fixed house edge. No strategy changes the math. Anyone claiming otherwise is selling something.
