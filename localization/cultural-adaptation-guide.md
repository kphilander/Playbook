# Cultural Adaptation Guide

Playbook content is written in a specific cultural voice. That voice works well in markets where gambling is openly discussed, humor is direct, and individual empowerment is the default frame. In other markets, the same information needs a different delivery.

This guide helps you adapt Playbook content for your market using five plain-language spectrums. You don't need to know the underlying research — just pick the value on each spectrum that fits your audience, and this guide shows you what to change.

> **Note:** The five spectrums are defined in [`_taxonomy.yml`](../_taxonomy.yml) under `cultural_profile`. Content files use these values in their YAML frontmatter and flag specific passages with `<!-- ADAPT: type -->` markers.

---

## How to use this guide

1. **Read the five spectrums below.** For each one, pick the value that best describes your market.
2. **Compare to the Playbook default** (`peer / individual / irreverent / blunt / open`). Where your market differs, you'll need to adapt.
3. **Open the content files** you plan to deploy. Search for `<!-- ADAPT:` to find flagged passages.
4. **Use the examples in this guide** to understand what kind of rewrite each spectrum shift requires.
5. **Presentation tags** (odds format, currency, sports culture, language) are separate — see the [Presentation](#presentation-tags) section.

---

## What doesn't change

The five spectrums adapt *how the Playbook voice speaks*. They never change *what the voice stands for*. Before adapting any content, confirm that the result still passes these tests:

- **Generous with information** — the voice shares because players should have it, not to show off expertise
- **Respectful of intelligence** — never talks down, never patronizes, regardless of voice register
- **Honest about how things work** — no spin, no scare tactics, even in diplomatic or contextual delivery
- **Treats gambling as entertainment** — fun is the point, in every market
- **Corrects without judgment** — the information matters, not the messenger's superiority

**The emotional test:** After adapting a piece of content, read it aloud. If it sounds like it was written by someone who doesn't respect the reader — or by someone who doesn't like gambling — the adaptation has drifted from brand DNA. Rewrite.

For the full list of brand DNA elements, see [Chapter 2 — Brand Personality](../brand-book/02-brand-personality.md#brand-dna-vs-brand-expression).

## Spectrum 1: Voice

**Who's talking?**

### peer

The narrator is an equal — someone at the table with you. Conversational, first-person-plural, no credentials cited. Trust is built through relatability and shared experience.

> **Playbook example (current default):**
> "Here's how it actually works. Every spin is independent. The machine doesn't know — or care — what happened last time."

**When to use:** Markets where audiences respond to informal, egalitarian communication. Where the messenger matters less than the message. Where "let's figure this out together" resonates.

### authority

The narrator is a credentialed expert. Third-person, formal register. Trust is built through institutional credibility, citations, and demonstrated expertise.

> **Same content, authority voice:**
> "Each spin outcome is generated independently by a certified random number generator (RNG). Previous results have no statistical relationship to future outcomes."

**When to use:** Markets where audiences expect information to come from recognized institutions. Where expertise must be signaled before the audience engages. Where informal tone can undermine credibility.

### elder

The narrator is a respected community figure. Warm, relationship-first. Trust is earned through demonstrated care, not credentials. Stories and context come before data.

> **Same content, elder voice:**
> "Something worth knowing about these machines — each time you press the button, it starts fresh. What happened before doesn't change what happens next. That's how the technology works, and it's worth understanding."

**When to use:** Markets where trust is built through personal connection, not expertise. Where the audience needs to feel cared for before they'll absorb information. Where the narrator's warmth and patience are themselves a signal of credibility.

**Research basis:** Hofstede's power distance dimension measures how much a society accepts hierarchical authority. Low power distance cultures are comfortable with peer-to-peer educational framing. High power distance cultures expect information to come from established authorities. Meyer's "leading" scale captures similar dynamics in organizational communication.

---

## Spectrum 2: Framing

**Who benefits?**

### individual

The benefit is personal. "Your bankroll." "Your odds." "Your decision." The reader is an autonomous agent making choices for themselves.

> **Playbook example (current default):**
> "Set a budget before you play. Decide what you're comfortable spending — and stop when you reach it."

**When to use:** Markets where personal autonomy is the dominant value. Where "it's your money, your choice" resonates. Where self-interest is a legitimate and effective motivator.

### communal

The benefit is collective. Family, community, social circle. The reader is part of a network, and their decisions affect others.

> **Same content, communal framing:**
> "Setting a budget before playing helps protect the things that matter most — the plans, people, and priorities beyond the game."

**When to use:** Markets where decisions are understood as affecting the whole family or community. Where individual self-interest framing can feel selfish or isolating. Where "what does this mean for the people around me?" is the natural question.

**Research basis:** Hofstede's individualism/collectivism dimension is one of the most consistently validated cross-cultural differences. Individualist cultures define the self as autonomous; collectivist cultures define the self in relation to in-groups. This directly affects whether "protect yourself" or "protect your family" is the more effective message.

---

## Spectrum 3: Humor

**What register?**

### irreverent

Bold, sarcastic, confident. The humor has an edge. It's willing to be sharp, name uncomfortable truths, and make the reader laugh at themselves or the industry. Current Playbook default.

> **Playbook example:**
> "Think you've got a system that beats the house? Cool. The house has a system too. It's called math."

> **Another example:**
> "Your slot machine has the emotional range of a toaster."

**When to use:** Markets where audiences enjoy and understand sarcasm. Where a confident, slightly irreverent narrator is engaging rather than off-putting. Where humor makes educational content more memorable.

### warm

Inclusive, gentle, bonding. The humor brings people together rather than singling anyone out. No sarcasm, no targets. The tone is "we're all in this together."

> **Same content, warm humor:**
> "We've all met someone who swears they've cracked the code. The truth is simpler — and honestly, kind of interesting once you see it."

> "The machine doesn't root for you. It doesn't root for anyone, actually. That's what makes it fair."

**When to use:** Markets where sarcasm is read as aggression or disrespect. Where humor should bond rather than challenge. Where the reader should never feel like the joke's target.

### understated

Dry, wry. The humor is there but never announced. It implies rather than states. British-inflected: understatement, irony through litotes.

> **Same content, understated humor:**
> "The house, it's fair to say, has done the maths. Rather thoroughly."

> "The machine's feelings about your strategy are, it turns out, nonexistent."

**When to use:** Markets where bold humor feels forced or unsophisticated. Where wit is appreciated but should be discovered, not performed. Where restraint is itself a marker of intelligence.

### minimal

Content speaks through clarity, not personality. Facts are presented cleanly. The voice is professional, clear, and unadorned. Not cold — just focused.

> **Same content, minimal humor:**
> "No betting system changes the mathematical expectation of a game. The house edge is built into every game's structure."

> "Slot outcomes are determined by a random number generator. The machine does not track or respond to previous results."

**When to use:** Markets where humor in educational content feels inappropriate. Where seriousness signals respect. Where the audience trusts data presentation over narrator personality.

**Research basis:** Cross-cultural humor research (Jiang et al., 2019) shows significant variation in how humor styles are perceived across cultures. What one culture reads as wit, another reads as aggression. Martin et al.'s (2003) humor styles framework distinguishes affiliative humor (bonding) from aggressive humor (sarcasm/teasing). Sarcasm comprehension varies with both cultural context and uncertainty tolerance. In high-context cultures, the boundary between irony and literal meaning is already doing cultural work, making additional layers of sarcasm hard to parse.

---

## Spectrum 4: Directness

**How do you deliver hard truths?**

### blunt

Straight out. No softening. "This bet is bad, and here's the math." The reader gets the conclusion immediately, backed by evidence.

> **Playbook example (current default):**
> "The house edge on American roulette is 5.26%. That's one of the worst bets on the casino floor."

**When to use:** Markets where audiences appreciate frankness. Where softening a message makes it feel less trustworthy. Where "just tell me" is the audience's preference.

### diplomatic

The message arrives with context and framing that softens the impact without changing the facts. The truth is delivered, but wrapped.

> **Same content, diplomatic:**
> "American roulette carries a house edge of 5.26% — higher than most table games. That difference adds up, especially over a longer session."

**When to use:** Markets where bluntness feels rude or confrontational. Where the audience needs to feel respected while being informed. Where the same fact delivered gently is more likely to be absorbed.

### contextual

The conclusion is never stated directly. Instead, the content builds context — through story, analogy, or comparison — and lets the reader arrive at the conclusion themselves. This is the highest-effort adaptation but the most effective in cultures where directness is uncomfortable.

> **Same content, contextual:**
> "If you compare the major table games side by side, the differences are worth noticing. Blackjack gives up about 0.5% to the house. Baccarat, about 1%. Roulette, depending on the version, gives up between 2.7% and 5.26%. Over an evening, those differences shape the experience more than most players realize."

**When to use:** Markets where being told "this is bad" feels like a judgment. Where the reader prefers to draw their own conclusions from well-presented information. Where indirectness is not avoidance but respect.

**Research basis:** Meyer's "evaluating" scale distinguishes direct negative feedback cultures (where frank criticism is professional) from indirect ones (where negative messages are wrapped in positive framing). Hall's high-context/low-context framework captures a related dynamic: in low-context cultures, meaning is in the explicit words; in high-context cultures, meaning is embedded in relationships, situation, and what is left unsaid.

## Spectrum 5: Comfort

**How openly is gambling discussed?**

### open

Gambling is entertainment. It's discussed the way you'd discuss movies, sports, or dining out. The words "gambling," "betting," and "playing" appear freely. Content assumes the reader is an active player and that's fine.

> **Playbook example (current default):**
> "Every time you gamble, you're making a series of decisions. Some of those decisions are better than others. This guide helps you see which is which."

**When to use:** Markets where gambling is a normalized leisure activity. Where the audience self-identifies as a player without discomfort. Where talking about gambling is no different from talking about any other entertainment.

### reserved

Gambling is acknowledged but not centered. Content frames itself as financial literacy or entertainment math rather than "gambling education." The audience may play, but the content doesn't assume or celebrate that.

> **Same content, reserved framing:**
> "Understanding how odds work is useful whether you're comparing subscription services, evaluating a loyalty program, or spending an evening at a casino. This guide breaks down the math."

**When to use:** Markets where gambling is legal but not culturally celebrated. Where the audience would engage with the content but not share it on social media. Where the framing should feel educational, not recreational.

### private

Gambling is socially sensitive. Content never implies the reader is a gambler. It positions itself as general knowledge — "how odds work in everyday life." The content should be useful and engaging even if the reader would never admit to gambling.

> **Same content, private framing:**
> "Probability shapes more of our daily decisions than we realize — from insurance to entertainment to how products are priced. Understanding the math behind chance helps you make clearer choices everywhere."

**When to use:** Markets where gambling carries social stigma. Where being identified as a gambler would cause the reader embarrassment or social cost. Where the content must respect that the reader's relationship to gambling is private.

**Research basis:** Hofstede's indulgence/restraint dimension captures how freely a society permits gratification of desires related to enjoying life. Restrained cultures suppress gratification through strict social norms. Separately, research on gambling in East Asian communities (Loo et al., 2022) documents how the concept of "face" — positive social self-worth — makes gambling-related stigma extend beyond the individual to the entire social network. The implication for content is that labeling the audience as "gamblers" can itself cause harm in face-sensitive cultures, even when the content is educational.

## How Playbook content currently reads

The current Playbook is written as:

| Spectrum | Current value | What this means |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Voice | **peer** | First-person-plural, conversational, no credentials |
| Framing | **individual** | "Your bankroll," "your decision," personal agency |
| Humor | **irreverent** | Sarcastic, bold, willing to be sharp |
| Directness | **blunt** | "This bet is terrible" — facts first, no softening |
| Comfort | **open** | Gambling is entertainment, discussed freely |

This profile works well in markets that are individualist, low-context, sarcasm-receptive, and comfortable discussing gambling openly. It may need adaptation in markets that differ on one or more spectrums.

---

## Adaptation decision tree

### Step 1: Profile your market

For each spectrum, pick the value that fits your audience:

```
Voice:      [ ] peer    [ ] authority    [ ] elder
Framing:    [ ] individual    [ ] communal
Humor:      [ ] irreverent    [ ] warm    [ ] understated    [ ] minimal
Directness: [ ] blunt    [ ] diplomatic    [ ] contextual
Comfort:    [ ] open    [ ] reserved    [ ] private
```

### Step 2: Identify what changes

| If you differ on... | What needs adaptation |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Voice | Rewrite narrator tone throughout. Peer→Authority requires formalization. Peer→Elder requires warmth-building. |
| Framing | Change "your" language to communal framing. Update CTAs and benefit statements. |
| Humor | Rewrite or remove humorous passages. Search for `<!-- ADAPT: humor -->` markers. |
| Directness | Soften or contextualize judgmental statements. Search for `<!-- ADAPT: directness -->` markers. |
| Comfort | Reframe gambling-specific language as general entertainment or financial literacy. |

### Step 3: Find flagged passages

Content files contain `<!-- ADAPT: type -->` markers that flag passages needing cultural attention. These comments are invisible in rendered markdown but searchable in the source files.

The marker types correspond to taxonomy values:

| Marker | What it flags |
|--------|--------------|
| `<!-- ADAPT: humor -->` | Sarcastic, ironic, or culturally specific humor |
| `<!-- ADAPT: currency -->` | Dollar amounts and currency-specific examples |
| `<!-- ADAPT: odds_format -->` | American odds (-110 format) |
| `<!-- ADAPT: sports_culture -->` | U.S.-specific sport references (NFL, NBA, MLB, etc.) |
| `<!-- ADAPT: framing -->` | Individual-focused benefit language |
| `<!-- ADAPT: directness -->` | Blunt evaluative statements |
| `<!-- ADAPT: comfort -->` | Language that assumes open comfort with gambling |

### Step 4: Adapt and tag

After adapting content, update the file's YAML frontmatter to reflect the new profile:

```yaml
cultural_profile:
  voice: elder
  framing: communal
  humor: warm
  directness: diplomatic
  comfort: reserved
adaptation_status: adapted
```

### Step 5: Test the adaptation

After deploying adapted content, test whether the adaptation improved the player experience using the Cultural Fit A/B test in the [Player Testing Protocol](../research/player-testing-protocol.md#cultural-fit-testing). File results using the [Research Findings issue template](https://github.com/kphilander/Playbook/issues/new?template=research-findings.yml) to share findings back to the project.

## Presentation tags

Presentation tags handle mechanical localization — format and reference changes that don't require cultural judgment. These are defined in [`_taxonomy.yml`](../_taxonomy.yml) under `presentation`.

### Odds format

| Value | Format | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `american` | Moneyline (+/-) | -110, +150 |
| `decimal` | Multiplier | 1.91, 2.50 |
| `fractional` | Ratio | 10/11, 3/2 |
| `mixed` | Shows multiple | -110 (1.91) |

Current Playbook default is `american`. Most markets outside the U.S. use `decimal`. The UK traditionally uses `fractional`.

### Currency

Replace dollar amounts with local currency equivalents. When adapting:
- Use round numbers that feel natural in the local currency
- Adjust scale appropriately (e.g., $100 ≠ 100 JPY — use 10,000 JPY)
- Match local conventions for symbol placement and decimal formatting

### Sports culture

Replace U.S.-centric sport references with locally relevant equivalents:

| Value | Primary sports | Typical betting references |
|-------|---------------|---------------------------|
| `us-major-leagues` | NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL | Point spreads, moneylines, parlays |
| `football-global` | Soccer/football leagues | Match odds, accumulators, Asian handicaps |
| `cricket-racing` | Cricket, horse racing, rugby | Match betting, each-way, top batsman |
| `horse-racing-primary` | Horse racing, boat racing | Win/place/show, exacta, pari-mutuel |
| `pachinko-mahjong` | Pachinko, mahjong, horse racing | Machine selection, payout rates |
| `multi-sport` | No single sport dominates | Generic examples that don't assume any sport |
