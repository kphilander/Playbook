# Visual Identity

Production-ready design assets and specifications for the Playbook brand system. Everything here is generated from or references [`_brand.yml`](../_brand.yml).

## Design Tokens

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [design-tokens.css](design-tokens.css) | CSS custom properties for the full visual system — colors, typography, spacing, borders, shadows, and transitions. Auto-generated by `node lib/generate-tokens.mjs`. |

## Asset Folders

| Folder | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| [logo/](logo/) | 15 SVG logo variants — primary (full-color, on-light), secondary (reversed, monochrome), favicons, and helpline badges |
| [color/](color/) | Color accessibility contrast matrix (WCAG 2.1 AA analysis) |
| [typography/](typography/) | Type specimen, typography CSS, self-hosted font files (Inter, Source Sans 3, Source Code Pro) |
| [iconography/](iconography/) | 31 SVG icons across 7 categories, icon library reference, and interactive preview |
| [photography/](photography/) | Photography direction, mood board, and reference examples (good/bad) |
| [illustration/](illustration/) | Illustration style guide and visual reference |
| [motion/](motion/) | Motion and animation specification |
| [tier-2/](tier-2/) | Tier 2 (support/crisis) visual identity — adapted color palette, softer typography, and layout guidelines |

## How it connects

- **Brand book chapter 3** ([Visual Identity](../brand-book/03-visual-identity.md)) provides the conceptual framework. This folder has the production assets.
- **`design-tokens.css`** is imported by web projects for consistent styling.
- **Logo and icon SVGs** are generated by scripts in [`collateral/render/`](../collateral/render/) (`build-logos.mjs`, `build-icons.mjs`).
- **All colors, fonts, and visual values** cascade from [`_brand.yml`](../_brand.yml). Edit the config, re-run `npm run generate`, and everything updates.
