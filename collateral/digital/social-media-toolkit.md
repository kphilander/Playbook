### Thread format — "The Real Math Behind [Game]"

**Thread 1: Slot Machines**

| Tweet | Content |
|---|---|
| 1 (Hook) | Your "lucky machine" has the emotional range of a toaster. Here's how slot machines actually work. A thread. 🧵 |
| 2 | Every modern slot machine uses a random number generator (RNG). It picks a number the instant you press spin. Everything else — the spinning reels, the sounds — is just presentation. |
| 3 | The RNG doesn't know your name. It doesn't know you've been sitting there for 3 hours. It doesn't know you "almost" won last time. Each spin is completely independent. |
| 4 | The house edge on slots ranges from 2% to 15%. That's the math built into every machine. Over time, the casino keeps that percentage. That's how the business works. |
| 5 | What can you control? Your budget. Your session time. Your game choice. Set a deposit limit before you play. It takes 10 seconds. |
| 6 | Facts worth knowing. Tools worth using. More at {{CONTENT_HUB_URL}} |

### One-liner templates

| Theme | Tweet |
|---|---|
| Odds fact | The house edge on American roulette is 5.26%. European roulette: 2.7%. One extra zero. Double the edge. |
| Myth-buster | "I'm due for a win" is the most expensive belief in gambling. Each spin is independent. The machine doesn't owe you anything. |
| Tool promo | Deposit limits take 10 seconds to set. It's like a seatbelt for your bankroll — set it and forget it. |
| Quiz hook | How well do you really know the odds? Most people get question 3 wrong. Take the quiz → {{QUIZ_URL}} |
| Shareable fact | A -110 line means you bet $110 to win $100. The $10 difference is the sportsbook's cut. On every bet. |

### Poll formats

| Poll question | Options |
|---|---|
| "A slot machine hasn't paid out in 3 hours. What are the odds on the next spin?" | Same as always / Higher / Lower / Depends on the machine |
| "What's the house edge on blackjack with basic strategy?" | 0.5% / 2% / 5% / 10% |
| "What percentage of your entertainment budget do you set aside for gambling?" | 0–10% / 10–25% / 25–50% / I don't budget for it |

### Industry-facing post templates

#### Template 1 — Thought leadership

> **Player education doesn't have to look like a compliance checkbox.**
>
> Most gambling operators treat responsible gambling content as a regulatory afterthought — minimum-size helpline text buried in footers, generic "Gamble Responsibly" slogans that nobody reads, and clinical language that players actively avoid.
>
> What if player education content got the same design investment as commercial marketing?
>
> {{PROGRAM_NAME}} is built on a simple premise: players who understand how games work make better decisions. Not because we tell them to — because they want to.
>
> The approach: entertainment-grade production quality, specific actionable content, and a voice that treats players like adults.
>
> The result: content that earns engagement instead of meeting minimums.
>
> {{CONTENT_HUB_URL}}

#### Template 2 — Program results

> **What happens when you treat player education like a product, not a policy?**
>
> Early results from operators using the {{PROGRAM_NAME}} framework:
>
> - {{METRIC_1}}
> - {{METRIC_2}}
> - {{METRIC_3}}
>
> The framework is open-source. The brand system is white-label. The content library is deploy-ready.
>
> If you're building player education content, let's talk.

## Hashtag strategy

### Primary tags (every post)

| Tag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `#KnowYourGame` | Primary brand hashtag |
| `#{{PROGRAM_NAME}}` | Brand name (operator-specific) |

### Category tags (use 2–3 per post)

| Category | Tags |
|---|---|
| Odds education | `#HouseEdge` `#RealOdds` `#GameMath` |
| Myth-busting | `#MythVsMath` `#GamblingFacts` |
| Tools | `#PlayYourWay` `#SetYourLimits` |
| Quiz / engagement | `#GameIQ` `#QuizTime` `#ChallengeYourFriends` |
| Sports betting | `#BettingMath` `#StraightTalk` |

### Tags to avoid

- `#ResponsibleGambling` — too generic, doesn't drive action
- `#GambleResponsibly` — retire this phrase entirely
- `#ProblemGambling` — clinical; not for Tier 1 content
- `#Addiction` — Tier 2 only; never in social content
