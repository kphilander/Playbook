## Digital vs. static signage decision guide

| Factor | Static signage | Digital signage |
|---|---|---|
| **Cost** | Lower upfront, replacement cost for updates | Higher upfront, easy content updates |
| **Content freshness** | Fixed — requires reprinting for changes | Dynamic — update remotely, schedule rotations |
| **Best for** | Restrooms, stall cards, break rooms | Entrance displays, gaming floor, high-traffic areas |
| **Power** | None required | Requires power + network |
| **Dwell time match** | Long-dwell locations (restrooms, tables) | Short-dwell locations (corridors, entrances) |
| **Multilingual** | Requires separate prints per language | Rotate languages on schedule |
| **Maintenance** | Replace when worn (monthly) | Screen cleaning, software updates |
| **Recommendation** | Use for fixed-message locations | Use for high-traffic, rotating-content locations |

---

## Multilingual notes

- In venues serving diverse communities, provide signage in the top 2–3 languages spoken locally
- For static signage: produce separate versions per language (do not mix languages on one sign)
- For digital signage: rotate languages on a timed schedule (minimum 15 seconds per language)
- Helpline numbers may differ by language — verify with local support providers
- QR codes should link to language-specific landing pages where available
