# Conversation Scripts — CS Scenario Guide

Full dialogue trees for 8 customer service scenarios. Each script includes opening, key phrases, what to say, what NOT to say, escalation criteria, and closing.

> **Operator note**: Replace all `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` tokens with values from `_brand.yml`. All agents should complete training on these scripts before handling player contacts. Tone should match the [voice and tone guide](../../brand-book/04-voice-and-tone.md) — warm, direct, never clinical or condescending. See the [language guide](../../brand-book/04-voice-and-tone.md#language-guide) for preferred terminology.

> **Logo usage (not applicable to scripts)**: Conversation scripts are verbal/text interactions with no visual logo display. If printed as staff reference cards, use the {{PROGRAM_NAME}} logo per the [logo system](../../brand-book/03-visual-identity.md#1-logo-system): full-color variant (navy Play + navy BOOK) on white/light backgrounds, reversed variant (white Play + teal BOOK) on dark backgrounds. Minimum height: 0.25" (print). Maintain 1x logo-height clear space.

## General guidelines

### Tone principles

- **Be warm, not clinical.** You're a person helping another person — not a system delivering a protocol.
- **Be direct, not evasive.** If you can help, say how. If you need to transfer, say why.
- **Use Playbook language.** Say "tools" not "interventions." Say "pause" not "ban." Say "player" not "gambler."
- **Never diagnose.** You are not a counselor. You provide information, tools, and referrals.
- **Listen first.** Let the player finish before responding. Don't interrupt with scripted language.

### Universal dos and don'ts

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| Use the player's name if available | Use clinical terms (pathological, addicted, disordered) |
| Acknowledge their concern before solving | Minimize their concern ("It's not that bad") |
| Offer options, not mandates | Tell them what they "should" do |
| Mention the helpline naturally, not as a warning | Lead with the helpline before understanding the request |
| Speak at the player's pace | Rush through a script |
| Use simple, clear language | Use jargon or corporate language |

## Scenario 1 — Player asks about deposit limits

**Trigger**: "How do I set a deposit limit?" / "Can I limit my deposits?" / "Where are my limits?"

**Tone**: Confident / Informative

### Dialogue tree

**Opening**:

> "Great question. Deposit limits are one of the most useful tools we have. Let me walk you through it."

**Walkthrough**:

> "You can set a daily, weekly, or monthly deposit limit right in your account settings. Just go to [exact navigation path] and you'll see the option to set your number."
>
> "Once it's set, it works in the background — you won't be able to deposit more than your limit in that period. You can adjust it anytime."

**If player asks "What number should I set?"**:

> "That's completely up to you. Think of it as your entertainment budget — the amount you're comfortable spending on gaming in that period. There's no right or wrong number."

**If player asks about reducing vs. increasing**:

> "Reducing your limit takes effect immediately. If you want to increase it, there's a cooling-off period of [{{COOL_OFF_PERIOD}}] — that's just to make sure the change is something you still want after some time."

**Closing**:

> "Is there anything else I can help with? And just so you know — if you ever want to explore other tools like session reminders or your activity dashboard, they're all in the same place."

### Key phrases to use

- "Your tools, your call"
- "Entertainment budget"
- "Works in the background"
- "Completely up to you"

### What NOT to say

- "You should set a limit" (don't prescribe)
- "This will help you control your gambling" (don't pathologize)
- "Are you having a problem?" (don't diagnose)

### Escalation: None typically needed.

## Scenario 2 — Player asks how odds work

**Trigger**: "How do odds work?" / "What's the house edge?" / "Am I likely to win?"

**Tone**: Confident / Informative

### Dialogue tree

**Opening**:

> "Happy to explain. Every game has something called a house edge — it's the mathematical advantage built into the game."

**Explanation**:

> "For example, blackjack with basic strategy has a house edge of about half a percent. American roulette is about five point two six percent. Slots can range from two to fifteen percent depending on the machine."
>
> "What this means in practice: over time, for every hundred dollars you wager on American roulette, the casino keeps about five dollars and twenty-six cents. That's the cost of the entertainment."

**If player asks "So I can't win?"**:

> "You absolutely can win in any given session — that's what makes it exciting. The house edge is a long-term average, not a prediction for each session. But knowing the edge helps you pick your games and set your budget realistically."

**If player asks about a specific game**:

> "I can look up the specific house edge for [game]. We also have a full odds comparison in our {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content hub — it covers every major game type with real numbers."

**If player asks about "systems" or "strategies"**:

> "No betting system changes the house edge — it's built into every game. Strategies like basic blackjack strategy can lower the edge, but they can't eliminate it. The math is the math."

**Closing**:

> "We have a game IQ quiz in the {{PROGRAM_NAME}} section that covers all of this — most people find it pretty eye-opening. Want me to send you the link?"

### Key phrases to use

- "House edge" (not "odds against you")
- "Cost of the entertainment"
- "Helps you pick your games and set your budget"
- "The math is the math"

### What NOT to say

- "The odds are stacked against you" (alarming)
- "You'll probably lose" (deficit framing)
- "You should only bet what you can afford to lose" (generic, preachy)

### Escalation: None typically needed.

## Scenario 3 — Player wants to pause their account

**Trigger**: "I want to take a break" / "Can I pause my account?" / "I need to stop for a while" / "How do I self-exclude?"

**Tone**: Warm / Direct

### Dialogue tree

**Opening**:

> "Absolutely. You can pause your account, and I can help you with that right now. Can I ask — are you looking for a short break, like a few days or weeks, or something longer?"

**If short break (cool-off)**:

> "We have a cool-off option that lets you pause for [24 hours / 7 days / 30 days]. During that time, you won't be able to log in or play. When the period ends, your account becomes active again automatically."
>
> "Would you like me to set that up?"

**If longer break (self-exclusion)**:

> "We have a self-exclusion option for longer periods — [6 months / 1 year / 5 years / permanent]. During that time, your account is fully closed. You won't receive any marketing, and you won't be able to reopen the account until the period ends."
>
> "Would you like me to walk you through the options?"

**If player seems uncertain**:

> "There's no pressure to decide right now. You can start with a short cool-off if you want to try it out, or go longer if that feels right. It's your call."

**If player asks "What happens to my money?"**:

> "Any remaining balance in your account will be returned to you via [withdrawal method]. We'll process that as part of the pause."

**Closing**:

> "I've set that up for you. If you need anything during this time — or just want to talk — free, confidential support is available 24/7 at {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}. No judgment, ever."

### Key phrases to use

- "Pause your account" (not "ban yourself")
- "Take a break" (not "self-exclude" in opening — use it only when explaining the formal option)
- "It's your call"
- "No pressure to decide right now"

### What NOT to say

- "Are you sure?" (undermines their decision)
- "Do you have a gambling problem?" (don't diagnose)
- "You're banning yourself" (punitive framing)
- "You can't come back" (absolute, scary — explain the specific terms instead)

### Escalation: If the player expresses emotional distress during this conversation → transition to Scenario 4.

---

## Scenario 4 — Player in emotional distress

**Trigger**: Player is upset, crying, expressing despair, mentioning financial crisis, expressing thoughts of self-harm, or otherwise showing signs of acute emotional distress.

**Tone**: Warm / Direct. Full empathy. No scripts — be a human.

> **Critical**: This is the highest-priority scenario. If a player mentions self-harm or suicidal thoughts, follow your organization's crisis protocol immediately.

### Dialogue tree

**Opening (if player is emotional)**:

> "I hear you, and I'm glad you called. Whatever's going on, you don't have to figure it out alone."

**Do NOT say**:

- "Calm down" / "It's going to be okay" / "It's not that bad"
- "Have you considered setting a deposit limit?" (not the time for tool promotion)
- Anything diagnostic: "It sounds like you have a problem"

**Listen first**. Let the player talk. Don't interrupt. Acknowledge what they're saying.

**After listening**:

> "Thank you for sharing that with me. I want to make sure you get the right support."

**Offer helpline**:

> "There's a free, confidential service that specializes in this. You can talk to someone right now by calling {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}. They're available 24/7, and there's no judgment — they're there for exactly this kind of conversation."
>
> "If you'd prefer, you can also text {{TEXT_NUMBER}} or chat at {{CHAT_URL}}."

**If player wants to pause their account**:

> "I can help you pause your account right now. Let's do that, and then I'll make sure you have the support number too."

Process the pause immediately — don't add friction.

**If player mentions self-harm or suicidal thoughts**:

> Follow your organization's crisis protocol. This typically involves:
> 1. Stay on the line. Do not transfer to a queue.
> 2. Acknowledge: "I'm here with you."
> 3. Refer to crisis line: National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (988) or local equivalent.
> 4. Log the interaction per your crisis protocol.
> 5. Follow up per policy.

**Closing**:

> "You've done a brave thing by calling. The helpline is there whenever you need it — {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}. And I'm here if you need anything else from us."

### Escalation criteria

| Signal | Action |
|---|---|
| Player is upset but functional | Offer helpline, offer account pause, listen |
| Player mentions financial crisis | Offer helpline, offer account pause, do not offer financial advice |
| Player mentions self-harm or suicidal thoughts | Activate crisis protocol immediately |
| Player is under the influence | Be patient, speak clearly, offer to call back or provide written resources |

## Scenario 5 — Player disputes a limit they set

**Trigger**: "I want to remove my deposit limit" / "This limit is stopping me from playing" / "I didn't mean to set this" / "Override my limit"

**Tone**: Warm / Direct

### Dialogue tree

**Opening**:

> "I understand. Let me pull up your account and take a look at your current settings."

**Explain the process**:

> "Your deposit limit is currently set to [amount] per [period]. You set this on [date]."
>
> "To increase or remove a deposit limit, there's a cooling-off period of {{COOL_OFF_PERIOD}}. That means the change won't take effect for [duration]. This is designed to make sure any change is something you still want after some time."

**If player pushes back**:

> "I understand that's frustrating. The cooling-off period is there to protect the choice you made when you set the limit. It's not something we can override — it applies to everyone."

**If player gets angry**:

> "I hear you, and I understand this isn't what you wanted to hear. The cooling-off period is a standard feature for all limit changes. I can't speed it up, but I can help you with anything else in the meantime."

**If player asks "Why can't you just remove it?"**:

> "Limit changes have a cooling-off period built in by design. When you set a limit, it's a decision you made for yourself. The delay gives you time to confirm that a change is still what you want. It's there to work for you, not against you."

**Closing**:

> "I've submitted the request to [increase/remove] your limit. It'll take effect on [date]. In the meantime, your current limit stays active. Anything else I can help with?"

### Key phrases to use

- "The choice you made" (reinforces their agency)
- "It's designed to protect your decision"
- "Standard feature for all players"

### What NOT to say

- "It's for your own good" (patronizing)
- "We can't let you do that" (adversarial)
- "Are you sure you want to remove it?" (questioning their judgment)
- "Maybe you should keep it" (prescriptive)

### Escalation: If the player becomes verbally abusive → follow standard escalation protocol. If they express distress → transition to Scenario 4.

## Scenario 6 — Concerned family member calls

**Trigger**: Someone calls about a family member's gambling behavior.

**Tone**: Warm / Direct. Empathetic. Take them seriously.

### Dialogue tree

**Opening**:

> "Thank you for reaching out. I can hear this is important to you, and I want to make sure I point you to the right resources."

**Privacy boundary**:

> "I should let you know upfront — for privacy reasons, I'm not able to share any details about another person's account, including whether they have one. But I can absolutely help you with resources and next steps."

**If caller asks you to close someone's account**:

> "I'm not able to make changes to someone else's account — that has to come from the account holder. But I can tell you about the options available and how to have that conversation."

**Provide resources**:

> "The best resource I can offer is the helpline: {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}. They specialize in supporting people who are worried about someone's gambling. It's free, confidential, and available 24/7."
>
> "They can help you figure out how to talk to your [family member] about it, what tools are available, and what steps you can take."

**If caller asks for advice on what to do**:

> "I'm not a counselor, so I don't want to give you advice that's outside my expertise. But the helpline has trained counselors who specialize in exactly this. They can walk you through your options and help you plan a conversation."

**If caller mentions their family member is in crisis**:

> Transition to crisis resources. Provide {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}} and crisis line (988 or local equivalent).

**Closing**:

> "Thank you for caring enough to call. The helpline number again is {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}} — free, confidential, 24/7. They're there for you too, not just for players."

### Key phrases to use

- "Thank you for reaching out"
- "I want to make sure I point you to the right resources"
- "Free, confidential, available for you too"

### What NOT to say

- "Your [family member] may have a problem" (don't diagnose)
- "We'll look into their account" (privacy violation)
- "There's nothing we can do" (there is — referral to helpline)
- "They need to want to change" (not your place — leave that for counselors)

### Escalation: If caller describes imminent danger → follow crisis protocol.

## Scenario 7 — Player asks about "responsible gambling" tools

**Trigger**: "Where's your responsible gambling page?" / "Do you have responsible gambling tools?" / "What responsible gambling features do you have?"

**Tone**: Confident / Informative

> **Bridge note**: The player is using industry-standard language. Don't correct them — bridge naturally to Playbook language.

### Dialogue tree

**Opening**:

> "Yes, absolutely — we have a full set of tools and resources. Let me walk you through what's available."

**Bridge to Playbook language**:

> "We call it {{PROGRAM_NAME}} — it's our player tools and education hub. Here's what you'll find:"

**Tool overview**:

> "**Deposit limits** — set your entertainment budget for the week or month. Takes about ten seconds."
>
> "**Session reminders** — get a check-in at the interval you choose."
>
> "**Activity dashboard** — see your play stats, session history, and spending patterns."
>
> "**Game IQ quiz** — test your odds knowledge. Most people find it pretty interesting."
>
> "**Support resources** — free, confidential helpline available 24/7."

**If player asks about self-exclusion**:

> "You can also pause your account for a set period, or take a longer break through our self-exclusion option. I can help you with either of those right now if you'd like."

**Closing**:

> "All of these are in your account settings under {{PROGRAM_NAME}}, or I can send you a direct link to our content hub. Anything specific you'd like to set up right now?"

### Key phrases to use

- "Player tools and education hub" (bridges from "responsible gambling")
- "Entertainment budget" (not "gambling money")
- "Session reminders" (not "reality checks")
- "Pause your account" (not "self-exclude" in casual context)

### What NOT to say

- "You mean responsible gambling?" (don't parrot the term back)
- Nothing — just use Playbook language naturally without correcting the player

### Escalation: None typically needed. If they express distress → transition to Scenario 4.

---

## Scenario 8 — Player wants to increase their limits

**Trigger**: "I want to increase my deposit limit" / "Can I raise my limit?" / "My limit is too low"

**Tone**: Warm / Direct

### Dialogue tree

**Opening**:

> "Sure, I can help with that. Let me pull up your current settings."

**Explain the process**:

> "Your deposit limit is currently set to [amount] per [period]. To increase it, there's a cooling-off period of {{COOL_OFF_PERIOD}}. That means the increase won't take effect until [date]."

**If player asks why there's a delay**:

> "When you set a limit, it's a decision you made for yourself. The cooling-off period is there to make sure any increase is something you still want after some reflection. It applies to all limit increases — it's a standard feature."

**Process the request**:

> "I'll submit the request now. Your limit will increase to [new amount] on [date]. Until then, your current limit of [amount] stays active."

**Offer context (light touch — don't lecture)**:

> "Just so you know, you can also review your activity in the dashboard to see your recent play patterns. That might be useful context as you adjust your budget."

**Closing**:

> "All set. The change will take effect on [date]. Anything else I can help with?"

### Key phrases to use

- "Your budget"
- "A decision you made for yourself"
- "Standard feature"
- "Useful context"

### What NOT to say

- "Are you sure you want to increase it?" (questioning their judgment)
- "That's a lot of money" (judgmental)
- "Maybe you should talk to someone first" (prescriptive, unless they're showing distress)
- "I need to warn you that..." (adversarial)

### Escalation: If the player becomes agitated → de-escalate with patience. If they express distress → transition to Scenario 4.
