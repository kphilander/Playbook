## How tools work

### Q1. What tools are available to players?

Players have access to these features in their account settings:

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Deposit limits** | Caps how much a player can deposit in a day, week, or month |
| **Session reminders** | Sends a check-in notification at a player-chosen interval |
| **Activity dashboard** | Shows play stats — sessions, time, spending patterns |
| **Bankroll planner** | Calculates estimated play time based on budget and game type |
| **Cool-off period** | Pauses the account for 24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days |
| **Self-exclusion** | Closes the account for 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, or permanently |
| **Game IQ quiz** | 7-question odds quiz in the {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content hub |

### Q2. How does a player set a deposit limit?

They go to account settings → {{PROGRAM_NAME}} tools → deposit limits. They choose daily, weekly, or monthly and enter their amount. It takes about 10 seconds. The limit activates immediately.

### Q3. Can a player change their deposit limit?

Yes. **Reducing** a limit takes effect immediately. **Increasing** or **removing** a limit has a cooling-off period of {{COOL_OFF_PERIOD}} before it takes effect. This is by design — it protects the player's original decision.

### Q4. What happens when a player hits their deposit limit?

They'll see a notification telling them they've reached their limit and when it resets. They can't deposit more until the reset. The message is designed to be supportive, not punitive — "That's you playing on your own terms."

### Q5. How do session reminders work?

The player sets an interval (e.g., every 30 minutes, every hour). During play, a reminder appears showing how long they've been playing and their activity so far. They can dismiss it and keep playing, or choose to take a break.

### Q6. What's the difference between a cool-off and self-exclusion?

| Feature | Cool-off | Self-exclusion |
|---|---|---|
| **Duration** | 24 hours / 7 days / 30 days | 6 months / 1 year / 5 years / permanent |
| **Reversible** | Account reactivates automatically when period ends | Cannot be reversed during the exclusion period |
| **Marketing** | Paused during cool-off | Permanently removed during exclusion |
| **Terminology** | "Take a break" / "pause your account" | "Self-exclusion" (formal/Tier 2 contexts) |

### Q7. Can we override a player's limit or exclusion?

No. Player-set limits and exclusions cannot be overridden by staff. This is a fundamental design principle — the player's decision stands. The cooling-off period on increases is the only "delay," and it's there to protect their choice.

### Q8. What shows up on the activity dashboard?

The dashboard displays: total sessions, total play time, average session length, net result, deposit history, and limit usage. All data is player-facing — designed to be informative, not alarming. It uses the term "activity summary," not "loss report."

## Odds and house edge

### Q9. What is the house edge?

The house edge is the mathematical advantage built into every casino game. It's expressed as a percentage of each wager that the casino expects to keep over time. It's how the business works — it's not hidden or secret.

### Q10. What are the house edge numbers for common games?

| Game | House edge |
|---|---|
| Blackjack (basic strategy) | 0.5% |
| Craps (pass/don't pass) | 1.4% |
| Baccarat (banker bet) | 1.06% |
| European roulette | 2.7% |
| American roulette | 5.26% |
| Slots (average) | 2–15% |
| Sports betting (vig) | ~4.5% |

Use these numbers when players ask. They're public information.

### Q11. If a player asks "Can I win?", what do I say?

Say: "Absolutely — you can win in any given session. The house edge is a long-term average, not a prediction for each session. Knowing the edge helps you pick your games and set your budget."

Do NOT say: "The odds are against you" or "You'll probably lose over time."

### Q12. If a player claims they have a "system," what do I say?

Say: "No betting system changes the house edge — it's built into every game. Strategies like basic blackjack strategy can lower the edge, but they can't eliminate it."

Do NOT say: "That doesn't work" (dismissive) or "You're wrong" (confrontational). Present the math, not a judgment.

## Handling concerned others

### Q13. If a family member calls about a player's account, can I share information?

No. You cannot share any account details — including confirming whether someone has an account. This is a privacy requirement.

Say: "For privacy reasons, I can't share details about another person's account. But I can connect you with resources that can help."

### Q14. What resources do I offer a concerned family member?

- **Helpline**: {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}} — free, confidential, 24/7. Available for concerned others, not just players.
- **Text**: {{TEXT_NUMBER}}
- **Chat**: {{CHAT_URL}}
- **Reassure them**: "The helpline has trained counselors who specialize in helping people in your situation. They can help you plan a conversation and understand your options."

### Q15. If a family member asks me to close someone's account, what do I say?

Say: "I can't make changes to another person's account — that has to come from the account holder. But the helpline at {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}} can help you figure out how to approach the conversation. They're there for you too."

## Handling a player in distress

### Q16. What are the signs that a player is in distress?

| Sign | Example |
|---|---|
| **Emotional** | Crying, angry outbursts, expressing despair |
| **Financial** | Mentioning they can't afford rent/bills, asking to borrow money |
| **Behavioral** | Prolonged play without breaks, chasing losses aggressively |
| **Verbal** | "I can't stop," "I've lost everything," "I don't know what to do" |
| **Crisis** | Mentioning self-harm, expressing hopelessness |

### Q17. What do I do if a player is in distress?

1. **Listen.** Let them talk. Don't interrupt with scripted responses.
2. **Acknowledge.** "I hear you. Thank you for telling me."
3. **Don't diagnose.** Don't say "It sounds like you have a problem."
4. **Offer the helpline.** "Free, confidential support is available right now. {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}. They're there for exactly this."
5. **Offer to pause the account.** "Would you like me to pause your account? I can do that right now."
6. **If they mention self-harm** → follow your organization's crisis protocol immediately. Stay on the line. Refer to crisis line (988 or local equivalent).

### Q18. What should I NOT do if a player is in distress?

| Don't | Why |
|---|---|
| Say "Calm down" | Invalidates their feelings |
| Say "It's going to be okay" | You don't know that |
| Offer financial advice | You're not qualified — and it's not your role |
| Try to counsel them | You're not a counselor — refer to the helpline |
| Promote tools (limits, quizzes) | Not the time — focus on support |
| Share the interaction with coworkers casually | Confidentiality matters |

## Language and communication

### Q19. What terms should I use?

| Use | Instead of | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Player | Gambler | Neutral, respectful |
| Tools / features | Interventions / measures | Empowering, not clinical |
| Pause your account | Ban yourself | Temporary, empowered |
| Take a break | Self-exclude (in casual conversation) | Lower barrier |
| Session reminder | Reality check | "Reminder" is helpful, "reality check" is judgmental |
| Activity summary | Loss report | Neutral framing |
| Entertainment budget | Gambling money | Planned allocation |
| Check in | Self-assess | Casual, inviting |
| Support | Treatment (in Tier 1) | Lower barrier |
| House edge | Odds against you | Factual, not alarming |

### Q20. What phrases should I never use with players?

- "Gamble responsibly" — too generic, no actionable content
- "Problem gambler" — diagnostic label, not your place
- "Gambling addiction" — clinical term, Tier 2 only
- "You should..." — prescriptive, removes agency
- "We're required to tell you..." — makes it feel like compliance checkbox
- "Are you having a problem?" — diagnostic, invasive

### Q21. What if a player uses clinical language (like "addiction" or "problem gambling")?

Don't correct them. Meet them where they are. If they say "I think I have a gambling addiction," respond with empathy and offer the helpline:

> "Thank you for sharing that with me. Free, confidential support is available right now at {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}. They can help you work through what you're feeling."

### Q22. How do I mention the helpline without making it feel like a warning?

Integrate it naturally. Don't lead with it — mention it as one of many resources available.

Good: "And just so you know, free, confidential support is available 24/7 at {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}} — for any question about gambling."

Not good: "If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, call {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}."

## Regulatory requirements

### Q23. What age must a player be to gamble?

{{MIN_AGE}}+. This is a legal requirement. Age verification is mandatory during registration. If someone underage attempts to gamble, follow your organization's age-verification protocol.

### Q24. Where must the helpline number be displayed?

The helpline must be visible on every page/screen of the platform, in all marketing materials, on all print collateral, and on venue signage. It should be prominent — not buried in fine print. Minimum 14pt bold on print materials.

### Q25. Are there mandatory messages we have to display?

Yes — jurisdiction-specific. Common requirements include:

- Age restriction notice ({{MIN_AGE}}+)
- Helpline number display
- Gambling risk disclaimer
- Self-exclusion availability notice

See `jurisdictions/` for exact requirements per market. When required text is mandated word-for-word, use it exactly — but surround it with on-brand context.

### Q26. Can we opt players out of {{PROGRAM_NAME}} communications?

No. Players cannot be unsubscribed from {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content. This is policy, not just a preference. {{PROGRAM_NAME}} communications are distinct from marketing — they're player education and tool access.

---

## Where to direct players

### Q27. Where do players find their tools?

Account settings → {{PROGRAM_NAME}} section. All tools (deposit limits, session reminders, activity dashboard, cool-off, self-exclusion) are in one place.

### Q28. Where's the content hub?

The {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content hub is accessible from primary navigation (not buried in a footer). Direct URL: {{CONTENT_HUB_URL}}. It contains quizzes, odds information, articles, and tool guides.

### Q29. Where's the quiz?

The Game IQ quiz is in the content hub: {{QUIZ_URL}}. It's 7 questions, takes about 2 minutes, and players can share results with friends.

### Q30. Where do players get support?

| Channel | Details |
|---|---|
| **Call** | {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}} |
| **Text** | {{TEXT_NUMBER}} |
| **Chat** | {{CHAT_URL}} |
| **Availability** | 24/7 |
| **Cost** | Free |
| **Privacy** | Confidential |
