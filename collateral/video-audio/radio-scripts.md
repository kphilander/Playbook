# Radio Spot Scripts

Production-ready scripts for {{PROGRAM_NAME}} radio advertising. 3 x 30-second spots and 2 x 15-second spots.

> **Operator note**: Replace all `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` tokens with values from `_brand.yml`. Helpline number must be spoken clearly and repeated in every spot. Voice talent should sound natural and conversational — not announcer energy. See [application guidelines](../../brand-book/07-application-guidelines.md#radio-and-audio) for audio guidelines.

> **Logo usage (companion visuals only)**: Radio spots are audio-only and have no on-screen logo. If companion digital banners or print ads run alongside radio spots, use the {{PROGRAM_NAME}} logo per the [logo system](../../brand-book/03-visual-identity.md#1-logo-system): reversed variant (white Play + teal BOOK) on dark backgrounds, full-color variant on light backgrounds. Minimum size: 0.25" (print) or 24px (digital). Maintain 1x logo-height clear space. Co-branding with operator logo: vertical divider (neutral_300 `#A8A8C0`, 1px), {{PROGRAM_NAME}} logo no smaller than 60% of operator logo height.

## Voice direction (all spots)

| Property | Guideline |
|---|---|
| **Voice type** | Natural, conversational. Like a smart friend explaining something interesting. |
| **Energy** | The Sharp — confident, direct, a little knowing. Not announcer-read. |
| **Pace** | Moderate. Let the facts land. Don't rush the numbers. |
| **Not** | PSA tone. Medical disclaimer voice. Condescending. Dramatic. Urgent. |
| **Emphasis** | Marked with **bold** in scripts below. Light emphasis — don't overdo it. |
| **Helpline read** | Slow down for the number. Speak each digit clearly. Repeat once. |

## Spot 1 — "The Math" (30s)

**Theme**: Odds literacy
**Tone**: Confident / Informative

```
(Music: upbeat, modern, fades under VO)

VO: Every casino game has a house edge. It's the math built into the game
    — and it's not a secret.

    Blackjack: **half a percent**.
    Roulette: **five point two six percent**.
    Slots: anywhere from **two to fifteen percent**.

    That's how the business works. Knowing the edge helps you pick your
    games and set your budget.

    The facts are free. Learn more at {{CONTENT_HUB_URL}}.

    Free, confidential support is available twenty-four seven.
    Call **{{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}**. That's **{{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}**.

(Music out)
```

**Word count**: ~90. **Timing**: 30 seconds at moderate pace.

## Spot 2 — "Ten Seconds" (30s)

**Theme**: Tool promotion — deposit limits
**Tone**: Confident / Informative

```
(Music: upbeat, confident, fades under VO)

VO: Here's something that takes ten seconds and makes your whole session
    better.

    Set your deposit limit. Pick your number — weekly, monthly, whatever
    works. **Done.**

    Now you play without second-guessing. Your budget. Your limits.
    **Your call.**

    Session reminders, activity dashboards, odds quizzes — it's all
    built in. Find your tools at {{CONTENT_HUB_URL}}.

    Free, confidential support — for any question about gambling.
    Call **{{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}**. That's **{{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}**.

(Music out)
```

**Word count**: ~85. **Timing**: 30 seconds at moderate pace.

## Spot 3 — "Quiz" (30s)

**Theme**: Quiz hook
**Tone**: Playful / Witty

```
(Music: playful, light, fades under VO)

VO: Quick question.

    A slot machine hasn't paid out in three hours. What are the odds on
    the next spin?

    (Beat)

    If you said "higher" — you're wrong. **Same as always.** The machine
    doesn't have a memory. Every spin is independent.

    Most people get that wrong. **How about you?**

    Take the two-minute game IQ quiz at {{CONTENT_HUB_URL}}.
    Challenge your friends.

    Free, confidential support, twenty-four seven.
    **{{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}**. Again — **{{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}**.

(Music out)
```

**Word count**: ~85. **Timing**: 30 seconds at moderate pace. Note the beat (1-second pause) after the question.

| Property | Guideline |
|---|---|

| **Spot 4** | Brief intro, fades quickly |
| **Spot 5** | Warmer, softer. Acoustic guitar or soft pad. Still modern. |
| **Helpline read** | Music drops to near-silence for the number. Clean, clear. |

|---|---|---|
| Spot 1 (30s) | 180 WPM | Slight pause between edge numbers |
| Spot 2 (30s) | 170 WPM | Emphasis pause on "Done." and "Your call." |
