| **Music** | Modern, upbeat, electronic or indie. Confident but not aggressive. See [music direction](#music--sound-direction). |
| **Color grade** | Warm, high-contrast. Navy/teal/orange palette reflected in wardrobe and set design. |

| **Helpline** | On-screen text, minimum 5 seconds, final frame. White text on navy or teal background. |
| **Logo** | {{PROGRAM_NAME}} wordmark, horizontal (B2) layout, reversed variant (white Play + teal BOOK on navy bg) + operator logo in final frame. Min height 24px (digital). Maintain 1x logo-height clear space. Co-branding: {{PROGRAM_NAME}} logo no smaller than 60% of operator logo height; vertical divider (neutral_300 `#A8A8C0`, 1px) between logos.
