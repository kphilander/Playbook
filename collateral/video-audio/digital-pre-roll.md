## Format specs

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **Resolution** | 1920 x 1080 (16:9) |
| **Frame rate** | 30fps |
| **Aspect ratios** | Also deliver 1:1 (1080x1080) and 9:16 (1080x1920) for social placement |

### Skip-proof hook guidance

- First 5 seconds must deliver a complete, valuable thought
- On YouTube, the viewer can skip after 5 seconds — the hook must land before then
- Text overlay in first 5 seconds serves dual purpose: sound-off accessibility + skip-proof value
- The hook should make the viewer curious enough to stay, or satisfied enough to remember the message even if they skip

## Production checklist

- [ ] First 5 seconds work without sound (text overlay delivers the message)
- [ ] Helpline number visible as persistent text from 0:05 onward
- [ ] CTA link to content hub or quiz
- [ ] Total time exact (15.0s / 6.0s — no overrun)
- [ ] Delivered in 16:9, 1:1, and 9:16 aspect ratios
- [ ] Closed captions provided
- [ ] QR code scannable at screen distance (test on mobile and desktop)
- [ ] {{PROGRAM_NAME}} logo (reversed variant, min 24px, 1x clear space) and operator logo (co-branding rules: min 60% height ratio, vertical divider) in final frame
- [ ] No clinical language in any overlay text
- [ ] Lighting is cinematic/editorial — dramatic low-light is fine, dim ambient is not (see [photography lighting guide](../../visual-identity/photography/photography.md#lighting-guide))
- [ ] Game closeups serve the message or CTA — cut any that are purely decorative filler
- [ ] Bumper ads require zero audio to deliver the message
