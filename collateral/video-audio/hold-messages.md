## Voice and music direction

| Property | Guideline |
|---|---|
| **Voice** | Natural, warm, conversational. Like a smart friend, not a phone system. |
| **Pace** | Relaxed. Caller is waiting — don't rush. Let info breathe. |
| **Music bed** | Modern, upbeat instrumental. Lo-fi, light electronic, or acoustic indie. |
| **Music level** | Under voice — audible but not competing. Fades up between messages. |
| **Avoid** | Corporate hold music, jazz elevator loops, classical, anything somber |
| **Transitions** | Music rises gently between messages (3-second music break) |

## Intro script

**Duration**: ~15 seconds

```
(Music fades in: upbeat, modern, warm)

VO: Thanks for calling {{OPERATOR_NAME}}. We'll be with you shortly.

    While you wait, here are a few things worth knowing about the tools
    and features available to you.

(Music continues, transitions to Message 1)
```

**Timing**: 15 seconds at relaxed pace.

## Message 1 — "Odds Fact" (~60s)

**Theme**: House edge explained
**Tone**: Confident / Informative

```
(Music bed continues underneath)

VO: Did you know every casino game has a house edge?

    (2-second pause)

    The house edge is the mathematical advantage built into the game.
    It's how the business works — and it's not a secret.

    (2-second pause)

    Here are some real numbers.

    Blackjack, with basic strategy, has a house edge of just half a
    percent. That's the best odds in the casino.

    (1-second pause)

    American roulette? Five point two six percent. That extra zero on the
    wheel doubles the edge compared to European roulette.

    (1-second pause)

    Slots range from two to fifteen percent, depending on the machine
    and the casino.

    (2-second pause)

    Knowing the edge helps you pick your games and set your budget.
    The facts are free — visit the {{PROGRAM_NAME}} section of our
    website or app to learn more.

(3-second music break, transition to next message)
```

**Word count**: ~130. **Timing**: ~60 seconds with pauses.

## Message 2 — "Your Tools" (~60s)

**Theme**: Feature overview
**Tone**: Confident / Informative

```
(Music bed continues)

VO: While you're waiting, here's a quick look at the tools available
    in your account.

    (2-second pause)

    Deposit limits. Set your entertainment budget for the week or month.
    It takes about ten seconds, and you can adjust it anytime. Think of
    it as your budget for fun — you pick the number.

    (2-second pause)

    Session reminders. Time moves differently when you're playing —
    that's by design. Set a check-in interval, and we'll give you a
    nudge. No buzzkill. Just a quick update.

    (2-second pause)

    Activity dashboard. Your play stats, session history, and spending
    patterns — all in one place. No surprises. Knowledge is a feature.

    (2-second pause)

    Find all of these in your account settings, or visit the
    {{PROGRAM_NAME}} section of our website.

(3-second music break, transition to next message)
```

**Word count**: ~135. **Timing**: ~60 seconds with pauses.

## Message 3 — "Quiz Plug" (~60s)

**Theme**: Quiz and content hub
**Tone**: Playful / Witty

```
(Music bed continues — slightly more playful energy)

VO: Here's one for you while you wait.

    A slot machine hasn't paid out in three hours. What are the odds on
    the next spin?

    (3-second pause — let them think)

    Same as always. The machine uses a random number generator — it
    doesn't have a memory, and it doesn't know how long you've been
    sitting there. Every spin is independent.

    (2-second pause)

    Most people get that wrong. There are six more questions like that
    in our game IQ quiz — and it only takes two minutes.

    (1-second pause)

    You can find it in the {{PROGRAM_NAME}} section of our app or
    website. Challenge your friends when you're done.

    (2-second pause)

    We also have articles on how odds work, what the house edge means,
    and how to get the most out of your tools. Facts worth knowing.

(3-second music break, transition to next message)
```

**Word count**: ~140. **Timing**: ~60 seconds with pauses.

## Message 4 — "Support" (~60s)

**Theme**: Helpline reminder + support resources
**Tone**: Warm / Direct

```
(Music bed: softer, warmer tone)

VO: One more thing while you're on hold.

    Free, confidential support is available twenty-four seven — for any
    question about gambling. No judgment. Ever.

    (2-second pause)

    You can call {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}.

    (1-second pause)

    That's {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}.

    (2-second pause)

    You can also text {{TEXT_NUMBER}}, or chat online at {{CHAT_URL}}.

    (2-second pause)

    And if you'd like to pause your account or adjust your limits, you
    can do that anytime in your account settings. Your tools are always
    there.

    (2-second pause)

    We'll be with you shortly. Thanks for your patience.

(Music continues, loops back to intro or Message 1)
