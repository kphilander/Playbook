# Research

Player testing instruments for operators deploying {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content. This is brand effectiveness testing -- not clinical research.

## What's here

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [player-testing-protocol.md](player-testing-protocol.md) | Pulse (3 items) and Full (7 items) resonance surveys, delayed recall survey, cultural fit A/B testing, scoring guides, and a standard reporting format |

## How it works

1. **Pick a survey** -- Pulse for quick signal, Full for diagnostics or cultural adaptation testing
2. **Copy the questions** into your survey tool
3. **Collect 30+ responses** (60+ for cultural fit A/B tests)
4. **Score and interpret** using the benchmarks in the protocol
5. **Share findings** using the [Research Findings issue template](https://github.com/kphilander/Playbook/issues/new?template=research-findings.yml)

## How it connects

| This protocol... | Connects to... |
|-----------------|----------------|
| NPS + semantic differentials | Brand DNA in [Chapter 2](../brand-book/02-brand-personality.md#brand-dna-vs-brand-expression) |
| Cultural fit (A/B) | Five spectrums in [Cultural Adaptation Guide](../localization/cultural-adaptation-guide.md) |
| A/B testing rules | Testing guidance in [calls-to-action.md](../messaging/calls-to-action.md#ab-testing-guidance) |
| Reporting format | KPI framework in [Chapter 8](../brand-book/08-governance.md#measuring-success) |

## What this is NOT

- Not a clinical research protocol
- Not a harm-measurement tool
- Not a replacement for quantitative KPIs (it complements them)

See [Chapter 8 -- Governance](../brand-book/08-governance.md#what-not-to-measure) for what {{PROGRAM_NAME}} does and does not measure.
