# Chapter 2: Brand Personality

If [Chapter 1](01-brand-foundation.md) defines *what* {{PROGRAM_NAME}} stands for, this chapter defines *who* {{PROGRAM_NAME}} is. Brand personality is how the brand would behave if it were a person — how it speaks, how it makes people feel, and what instincts guide its behavior.

## Brand archetypes

### Primary: The Guide

{{PROGRAM_NAME}} is a knowledgeable, steady presence that helps players navigate their experience. The Guide archetype combines **wisdom** (deep understanding of how gambling works) with **warmth** (genuine care for the player's wellbeing).

The Guide:
- Has expertise but doesn't lecture
- Offers direction but respects the player's autonomy
- Is always available but never intrusive
- Speaks from experience, not authority

**Think of**: A trusted friend who happens to understand gambling really well. They'd tell you the odds are against you — not to make you feel bad, but because they want you to make an informed choice.

**Not**: A teacher, a doctor, a parent, or a regulator. The Guide doesn't grade you, diagnose you, scold you, or enforce rules on you.

### Secondary: The Ally

When a player is struggling or seeking help, {{PROGRAM_NAME}} shifts from Guide to Ally. The Ally archetype stands **with** the player, not above them. This is critical for moments of vulnerability — a player considering self-exclusion, reaching out to a helpline, or acknowledging a problem for the first time.

The Ally:
- Stands beside the player, not in front of them
- Validates without enabling ("It's okay to ask for help" not "It's okay to keep going")
- Removes barriers rather than adding steps
- Never judges, never says "I told you so"

## Personality traits

### The personality spectrum

{{PROGRAM_NAME}} defines its personality through pairs — what it is and what it deliberately is not. These pairs create guardrails that keep the brand consistent across different authors, channels, and contexts.

| We are... | We are not... |
|---|---|
| **Warm** — We care about the person, not just the player | **Clinical** — We don't use medical language or treat players as patients |
| **Direct** — We say what we mean, clearly and concisely | **Preachy** — We don't moralize or lecture about what players should do |
| **Modern** — We feel current, fresh, and relevant | **Bureaucratic** — We don't read like a government form or legal document |
| **Honest** — We tell the truth about odds, risks, and outcomes | **Alarming** — We don't use scare tactics or worst-case scenarios to shock people |
| **Empowering** — We give players agency over their own choices | **Controlling** — We don't dictate behavior or impose decisions |
| **Inclusive** — We welcome everyone, regardless of background | **Exclusive** — We don't use language that assumes a specific gender, age, culture, or gambling type |
| **Optimistic** — We believe in people's ability to make good choices | **Naive** — We don't minimize the real risks of gambling harm |
| **Steady** — We're consistent, calm, and reliable | **Reactive** — We don't change our message based on what's trending or convenient |
| **Playful** (where appropriate) — We can be lighthearted in educational contexts | **Flippant** — We never make light of gambling harm or people's struggles |

### Personality in action

**Warm, not clinical:**
- YES: "Lots of people check in on their gambling habits. It takes 2 minutes."
- NO: "This validated screening instrument assesses disordered gambling behavior."

**Direct, not preachy:**
- YES: "The house always has an edge. Here's how it works."
- NO: "You should be aware that gambling establishments are designed to profit from your losses."

**Modern, not bureaucratic:**
- YES: "Set your deposit limit — it takes 10 seconds."
- NO: "In accordance with responsible gaming policies, account holders may elect to establish voluntary deposit restriction parameters."

**Honest, not alarming:**
- YES: "1 in 100 adults experience serious gambling harm. Free support is available."
- NO: "GAMBLING DESTROYS LIVES. You could lose everything."

**Empowering, not controlling:**
- YES: "You're in control. Your $500 weekly limit is now active."
- NO: "Your account has been restricted to $500 per week."

## Emotional attributes

How should someone feel after interacting with {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content? These emotional targets guide every design and copy decision.

### What players should feel

| Emotion | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| **Informed** | "I understand how this works now." Knowledge reduces anxiety and builds confidence. |
| **Respected** | "This isn't talking down to me." Players who feel respected engage more deeply. |
| **Capable** | "I can handle this." Empowerment drives action — setting limits, seeking help, making choices. |
| **Welcome** | "This is for me, not just for people with problems." Universal prevention only works if everyone feels included. |
| **Safe** | "I can be honest here without being judged." Safety is the precondition for vulnerability and help-seeking. |

### What players should never feel

| Emotion | Why it's harmful |
|---|---|
| **Ashamed** | Shame is the leading barrier to help-seeking. If your RG content makes someone feel ashamed, it's actively causing harm. |
| **Patronized** | Players who feel talked down to disengage immediately. They stop reading, click away, and develop negative associations with RG content. |
| **Anxious** | Scare tactics backfire. Fear-based messaging causes avoidance, not behavior change. Players who feel anxious are less likely to engage with RG tools, not more. |
| **Confused** | Jargon, legalese, and complex instructions create friction. A player in distress who can't figure out how to self-exclude is a system failure. |
| **Targeted** | No player should feel singled out. RG content should feel like it's for everyone, not like the system has flagged them as a "problem." |

## Behavioral principles

These principles describe how {{PROGRAM_NAME}} "acts" — the behavior the brand demonstrates at touchpoints, regardless of medium.

### 1. Lead with value, not obligation

Every interaction should offer the player something useful *before* asking anything of them. Don't open with a warning; open with information. Don't open with a requirement; open with a benefit.

**Example**: A deposit limit prompt doesn't say "You are required to set a deposit limit." It says "Most players find deposit limits helpful — they let you decide in advance what works for your budget."

### 2. Be present, not persistent

{{PROGRAM_NAME}} information should always be visible and accessible, but never nagging. A player should always be able to find RG tools within one or two interactions — but they should never feel followed or surveilled.

**Example**: An RG section in account settings is always one tap away. But push notifications about RG tools are infrequent and contextual, not on a daily schedule.

### 3. Make the right thing easy

Every RG action should have the least possible friction. Setting a limit should be faster than not setting one. Finding a helpline number should be immediate. Self-exclusion should be simpler than account registration.

**Example**: A "Set a limit" button is prominently placed during deposit, pre-filled with a common amount, and confirmable in one tap.

### 4. Celebrate positive actions

When a player takes a responsible action — setting a limit, completing a self-assessment, activating a session reminder — acknowledge it positively. This creates a reinforcement loop that makes RG engagement feel rewarding.

**Example**: After setting a deposit limit, the confirmation screen says "You're set. Playing within your limits is one of the smartest things a player can do."

### 5. Never close a door

No matter what a player's situation is, there is always a next step. Even in self-exclusion confirmation, the message includes support resources. Even in a "you've exceeded your limit" notification, the tone is supportive, not punitive.

**Example**: A limit-reached notification says "You've reached your $200 weekly limit. Your limit resets Monday. If you'd like to talk to someone, free support is available 24/7."
