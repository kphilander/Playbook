# Introduction

> *"The best responsible gambling program is the one players actually use."*

## Why this brand book exists

Responsible gambling programs have a problem: nobody pays attention to them.

Across the industry, RG content is treated as a compliance checkbox. A "Gamble Responsibly" tagline appended to an advertisement. A helpline number in 8-point font at the bottom of a webpage. A self-exclusion form buried three levels deep in account settings. The message is technically present — but functionally invisible.

This isn't because operators don't care. Most invest significant resources in responsible gambling. The problem is *how* these programs communicate. When RG messaging looks and feels like a legal disclaimer, players treat it like one: something to scroll past, ignore, or dismiss.

Compass exists to close this **engagement gap**.

## The Compass philosophy

Compass is built on a simple insight: responsible gambling should feel like **self-care, not a warning sign**.

The wellness industry solved a similar problem. A decade ago, meditation was perceived as niche, clinical, and slightly uncomfortable to talk about. Brands like Calm and Headspace transformed that perception — making mindfulness feel accessible, modern, and something people *wanted* to integrate into their daily lives. They didn't change the practice; they changed the packaging.

Compass applies the same principle to responsible gambling:

- **Instead of warnings**, we provide information that helps players understand how gambling works
- **Instead of restrictions**, we offer tools that give players control over their experience
- **Instead of fine print**, we create content that players genuinely find useful
- **Instead of stigma**, we normalize checking in on your habits as a sign of strength

This isn't about softening the message. It's about delivering the message in a way that people actually receive it.

## Who this book is for

This brand book serves four primary audiences within an adopting organization:

### Brand managers and marketing teams
You'll use this book to ensure RG messaging is consistent, on-brand, and compliant across all channels. Start with [Chapter 4: Voice and Tone](04-voice-and-tone.md) and [Chapter 5: Messaging Framework](05-messaging-framework.md).

### Product and UX teams
You'll use this book to design RG features (deposit limits, reality checks, self-exclusion flows) that feel integrated into the product experience — not bolted on as an afterthought. Start with [Chapter 3: Visual Identity](03-visual-identity.md) and [Chapter 7: Application Guidelines](07-application-guidelines.md).

### Compliance and legal teams
You'll use the jurisdiction modules in `jurisdictions/` to verify that messaging meets regulatory requirements. Start with [Chapter 8: Governance](08-governance.md) and the relevant jurisdiction module for your market.

### Designers
You'll use the visual identity specifications and design briefs in `implementation/figma-briefs/` to create assets. Start with [Chapter 3: Visual Identity](03-visual-identity.md) for the system overview, then the specific brief for your deliverable.

## How to adapt this for your organization

Compass is a white-label system. The defaults represent our best recommendations, but every element is designed to be customized:

1. **Start with [`_brand.yml`](../_brand.yml)**: This configuration file drives the entire system. Update your program name, colors, fonts, helpline numbers, and jurisdictions here first.

2. **Keep what works**: You don't have to change everything. The voice and tone guidelines, language guide, and messaging framework are evidence-based and work well as-is for most operators.

3. **Customize the surface**: Most operators will want to adapt the visual identity (Chapter 3) to match their existing brand, while keeping the structural guidelines (Chapters 4-8) largely intact.

4. **Add your jurisdictions**: Select the relevant jurisdiction modules from `jurisdictions/` and verify the regulatory information with your legal team.

5. **Deploy incrementally**: You don't have to implement everything at once. Start with the messaging framework and voice guidelines — they deliver value immediately, even before you've created visual assets.

## A note on scope

This brand book does not cover:

- **Clinical treatment protocols** — Compass is a communications and branding framework, not a clinical intervention. Refer players to qualified professionals for treatment.
- **Legal compliance advice** — While jurisdiction modules provide regulatory information, they are reference guides, not legal opinions. Always verify requirements with qualified legal counsel.
- **Technology implementation** — Compass defines *what* RG features should communicate, not *how* to build them technically. Product engineering teams should use these guidelines as requirements input.
- **Gambling industry marketing** — Compass governs responsible gambling content only. It does not cover how to market gambling products themselves.
