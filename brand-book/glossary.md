# Glossary

This glossary is for **marketing teams**, not clinicians. It defines the gambling terms you'll encounter when creating {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content — plain-language definitions, Compass usage guidance, and what to avoid.

For the full language guide (preferred vs. avoided terminology), see [Chapter 4: Voice and Tone](04-voice-and-tone.md).

---

## A

### Accumulator (Acca)
A single bet combining multiple selections. All selections must win for the bet to pay out. Also called a parlay (US) or multi (AU).

**Compass usage**: Great myth-busting territory. "A 10-leg acca at even odds has about a 1-in-1,024 chance of winning. The bookmaker knows that. Now you do too."

### Activity summary
A report showing a player's gambling activity over a period — deposits, wagers, wins, losses, session time.

**Compass usage**: Use "activity summary" or "play summary." Avoid "loss report" or "spending report" — deficit-focused framing.

---

## B

### Bankroll
The amount of money a player has set aside for gambling.

**Compass usage**: Acceptable in Tier 1. Also use "entertainment budget" for broader contexts. "Your bankroll planner shows how far your budget goes."

### Bookmaker margin (Vig / Juice)
The built-in profit margin in sports betting odds. The gap between the true probability of an outcome and the odds offered.

**Compass usage**: Explain it simply: "The bookmaker's margin is like a commission on every bet. A typical margin is 5–10%. That's how sportsbooks make money."

---

## C

### Cool-off period
A short-term (typically 24 hours to 30 days) voluntary break from gambling. The player's account is temporarily inaccessible.

**Compass usage**: Use "cool-off period," "short break," or "pause." Avoid "temporary ban" or "suspension" — punitive framing.

---

## D

### Deposit limit
A maximum amount a player can deposit into their account over a set period (daily, weekly, monthly). Set by the player.

**Compass usage**: Frame as a feature, not a restriction. "Set your deposit limit" — not "Restrict your deposits." It's a budget tool, like a spending cap on a credit card.

---

## E

### Expected value (EV)
The mathematical average outcome of a bet if placed infinite times. A negative EV means the house has an edge.

**Compass usage**: "Expected value tells you what a bet is worth on average over time. Most casino bets have a negative EV — that's the house edge. It doesn't mean you'll lose every time. It means the math favors the house in the long run."

---

## G

### Gambler's fallacy
The mistaken belief that past random events affect future random events — e.g., "the roulette wheel hasn't hit red in 10 spins, so red is due."

**Compass usage**: Prime myth-busting material. "Each spin is independent. The wheel doesn't have a memory. Red isn't 'due' — the odds are exactly the same on every spin."

---

## H

### House edge
The mathematical advantage the casino has over the player, expressed as a percentage. A 5% house edge means the casino expects to keep $5 of every $100 wagered over time.

**Compass usage**: One of the most important educational concepts. Always explain what it means in practical terms, not just state the number. "The house edge on American roulette is 5.26%. That means for every $100 you bet over time, you'll lose about $5.26 on average."

---

## I

### In-play betting (Live betting)
Placing bets on a sporting event while it's in progress. Odds change in real time based on what's happening in the game.

**Compass usage**: Good territory for Open content. "In-play bets move fast. The average time between wagers is under 30 seconds. When the pace is high, analysis goes down and impulse goes up."

---

## L

### Limit (Deposit / Loss / Session / Wagering)
A boundary a player sets on their gambling activity. Deposit limits cap how much you can add to your account. Loss limits cap how much you can lose. Session limits cap how long you play. Wagering limits cap how much you can bet.

**Compass usage**: Always frame as player-owned. "Your limits" — never "restrictions on your account." The player sets the limit; the system enforces their decision.

---

## O

### Odds
The probability of an outcome, expressed as a ratio. Different formats: decimal (2.50), fractional (3/2), American (+150).

**Compass usage**: Always explain the format being used. "Odds of 2.50 mean you'd win $2.50 for every $1 bet — that's a $1.50 profit plus your $1 back."

---

## P

### Parlay
See **Accumulator**.

### Paytable
A chart on a slot machine or video poker game showing the payouts for each winning combination.

**Compass usage**: "Every slot has a paytable. It tells you what each combination pays and what the special features do. Read it before you play — it takes 30 seconds and it changes how you think about the game."

### Player
A person who gambles.

**Compass usage**: Always use "player" in Tier 1, not "gambler." "Player" is inclusive, neutral, and entertainment-framed.

---

## R

### Random Number Generator (RNG)
The software or hardware that generates random outcomes in digital gambling games. Ensures every spin, hand, or draw is independent.

**Compass usage**: Core Sharp content. "RNG means every spin is independent. The machine doesn't know you exist. It doesn't know what happened on the last spin. It doesn't know how long you've been playing. Every result is random."

### Return to Player (RTP)
The theoretical percentage of wagered money a game returns to players over time. An RTP of 96% means the game returns $96 for every $100 wagered on average. The inverse of the house edge.

**Compass usage**: "An RTP of 96% doesn't mean you'll get $96 back from a $100 session. It's a long-term average across millions of plays. In any single session, anything can happen — that's what makes it entertainment."

---

## S

### Self-exclusion
A formal process where a player voluntarily restricts their own access to gambling for a set period (typically 6 months to 5 years, sometimes permanent).

**Compass usage**: In Tier 1, use "take a break" or "pause your account" for light references. Use "self-exclusion" in Tier 2 and formal/regulatory contexts. Never use "self-ban" or "blacklisting."

### Session reminder
A notification that tells a player how long they've been playing. Configurable by the player.

**Compass usage**: Use "session reminder" or "time check." Avoid "reality check" — it implies the player has lost touch with reality. Frame it as a helpful feature: "Session reminders keep you aware without killing the vibe."

### Smart play
The Compass-preferred alternative to "responsible gambling." Encompasses informed decision-making, using tools, understanding the math, and playing within your own limits.

**Compass usage**: "Smart play" is aspirational — it's what knowledgeable players do. "Responsible gambling" implies the alternative is irresponsible, which stigmatizes.

---

## T

### Tilt
A state of emotional frustration that leads to poor decision-making. Borrowed from poker, but applicable to all gambling. Common triggers: losing streaks, near-misses, chasing losses.

**Compass usage**: Great myth-busting and self-awareness content. "Tilt is the most expensive thing in gambling. It's when emotion takes over from math. Recognizing it is the first step to avoiding it."

### Tools
The suite of features available to players — deposit limits, session reminders, activity dashboards, bankroll planners, cool-off periods.

**Compass usage**: Always "tools" or "features" — never "interventions," "measures," or "controls." Tools are things players choose to use. Interventions are things done to players.

---

## V

### Volatility (Variance)
How much a game's outcomes swing in the short term. High-volatility games have bigger wins and losses but less frequent payouts. Low-volatility games have smaller, more frequent payouts.

**Compass usage**: "High volatility means bigger swings — longer dry spells but bigger wins when they hit. Low volatility means steadier play — smaller wins, but more of them. Neither is better. It depends on what kind of experience you want."

---

## W

### Wagering requirement
The number of times a bonus or promotional credit must be wagered before it can be withdrawn as cash. A 30x wagering requirement on a $50 bonus means you must wager $1,500 before withdrawing.

**Compass usage**: Essential Open content. "Wagering requirements change the real value of a bonus. A $50 bonus with a 30x requirement means you need to wager $1,500 before you can cash out. At a 3% house edge, you'd statistically lose about $45 of that $1,500 in play. The 'free' $50 might cost you almost as much to unlock."
