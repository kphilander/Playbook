# Glossary: Responsible Gambling Terminology

This glossary defines the preferred terminology for {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content. Every person writing RG content should reference this guide. The preferred terms align with person-first, non-stigmatizing, empowering language principles established in [Chapter 4: Voice and Tone](04-voice-and-tone.md).

## How to use this glossary

- **Preferred term**: Use this in all {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content
- **Avoid**: Do not use these terms except where noted
- **Context**: When and how to use the preferred term
- **Why**: The rationale behind the preference

---

## A

### At-risk player
**Preferred**: "Player showing signs of risk" or "player at elevated risk"
**Avoid**: "At-risk gambler," "potential problem gambler"
**Context**: Use when describing players whose behavior patterns indicate increased risk of gambling harm — without labeling them.
**Why**: Person-first framing. "At-risk" is acceptable as a clinical category but should not be used as an identity label in player-facing content.

### Activity summary
**Preferred**: "Activity summary," "play summary"
**Avoid**: "Loss report," "spending report"
**Context**: Use when describing periodic summaries of a player's gambling activity.
**Why**: "Activity" is neutral. "Loss report" is deficit-focused and assumes the player has lost money.

---

## B

### Break (from gambling)
**Preferred**: "Break," "pause," "time away"
**Avoid**: "Ban," "restriction," "prohibition"
**Context**: Use when describing temporary self-exclusion or cool-off periods.
**Why**: "Break" is temporary and voluntary. "Ban" implies punishment. The player is making a choice, not receiving a sentence.

### Budget (gambling)
**Preferred**: "Budget," "spending limit," "entertainment budget"
**Avoid**: "Bankroll," "stake money," "funds"
**Context**: Use when helping players think about money management.
**Why**: "Budget" frames gambling spending as a planned, controlled allocation — like any other entertainment expense. "Bankroll" is insider language that normalizes high-frequency play.

---

## C

### Chasing losses
**Preferred**: "Chasing losses" (acceptable as a concept to explain) or "continuing to play to recover money"
**Avoid**: Using the term without explanation
**Context**: Always define the concept when using it: "Chasing losses means continuing to gamble in an attempt to win back money you've already spent. It's one of the most common patterns that leads to harm."
**Why**: The term is widely understood in RG but may be unfamiliar to general audiences. Always explain it.

### Concerned others
**Preferred**: "Someone you care about," "friends and family," "people close to you"
**Avoid**: "Loved one with a gambling problem," "codependent," "enabler"
**Context**: Use when addressing people who are worried about someone else's gambling.
**Why**: "Concerned others" is the clinical term (acceptable in professional contexts). For player-facing content, use warmer, more relational language. Never label the concerned person as part of the problem.

### Cool-off period
**Preferred**: "Cool-off period," "short break," "pause"
**Avoid**: "Temporary ban," "suspension"
**Context**: Use when describing a short-term (typically 24 hours to 30 days) voluntary exclusion.
**Why**: "Cool-off" implies a thoughtful, regulated return to baseline. "Ban" and "suspension" imply punishment.

---

## D

### Deposit limit
**Preferred**: "Deposit limit," "spending limit"
**Avoid**: "Deposit restriction," "deposit cap," "maximum deposit"
**Context**: Use when describing the tool that lets players set a maximum amount they can deposit over a period.
**Why**: "Limit" implies player choice. "Restriction" implies external control. The player sets their own limit; the system enforces their decision.

---

## E

### Entertainment budget
**Preferred**: "Entertainment budget," "play budget"
**Avoid**: "Gambling money," "betting funds"
**Context**: Use when helping players conceptualize their gambling spending.
**Why**: Framing gambling spending as part of an entertainment budget helps players apply the same financial discipline they use for other leisure activities.

---

## F

### Free help / Free support
**Preferred**: "Free, confidential support"
**Avoid**: "Free treatment," "free counseling" (unless specifically describing clinical services)
**Context**: Use when promoting helpline and chat services.
**Why**: "Support" has a lower perceived barrier than "treatment" or "counseling." Many people who would hesitate to call a "treatment line" will call a "support line."

---

## G

### Gambling disorder
**Preferred**: "Gambling disorder" (clinical/professional contexts)
**Avoid**: "Pathological gambling," "compulsive gambling," "gambling addiction" (in clinical contexts)
**Context**: Use when referring to the clinical diagnosis as defined in the DSM-5.
**Why**: "Gambling disorder" is the current clinical standard (DSM-5). "Pathological gambling" and "compulsive gambling" are outdated diagnostic terms.

### Gambling harm
**Preferred**: "Gambling harm," "gambling-related harm," "harm from gambling"
**Avoid**: "Gambling addiction" (in general contexts), "gambling problem" (as a clinical term)
**Context**: Use as the broad term for negative consequences of gambling — financial, emotional, relational, occupational, or health-related.
**Why**: "Harm" is broader than "addiction" and captures the full spectrum — from mild negative consequences to severe disorder. It also avoids the binary implication that people either have an "addiction" or don't.

---

## H

### Helpline
**Preferred**: "Helpline," "support line"
**Avoid**: "Crisis hotline," "addiction hotline" (unless it specifically is one)
**Context**: Use when referring to phone-based support services like 1-800-GAMBLER or GambleAware.
**Why**: "Helpline" has a lower perceived severity threshold. Players who wouldn't call a "crisis hotline" will call a "helpline."

### House edge
**Preferred**: "House edge," "built-in advantage"
**Avoid**: No specific avoidances — this is a factual, educational term
**Context**: Use when explaining how gambling operators make money and why long-term outcomes favor the house.
**Why**: Understanding the house edge is foundational to informed gambling. Always explain the concept, not just the term.

---

## I

### Informed choice
**Preferred**: "Informed choice," "informed decision"
**Avoid**: "Responsible choice" (implies the alternative is irresponsible)
**Context**: Use when describing the goal of RG education — enabling players to make decisions based on accurate information.
**Why**: "Informed" is factual and empowering. "Responsible" carries a moral judgment about what the "right" choice is.

---

## L

### Limit
**Preferred**: "Limit" (deposit limit, loss limit, session limit, wagering limit)
**Avoid**: "Restriction," "cap," "maximum"
**Context**: Use when describing any player-set boundary on their gambling activity.
**Why**: "Limit" implies ownership and agency. The player chooses their limit. "Restriction" implies something imposed on them.

### Loss limit
**Preferred**: "Loss limit," "maximum loss"
**Avoid**: "Loss restriction"
**Context**: Use when describing the tool that sets a maximum amount a player can lose over a period.
**Why**: Same principle as deposit limit — "limit" implies choice.

---

## P

### Person with a gambling problem
**Preferred**: "Person with a gambling problem," "person experiencing gambling harm"
**Avoid**: "Problem gambler," "gambling addict," "compulsive gambler," "pathological gambler"
**Context**: Use whenever referring to someone whose gambling is causing them harm.
**Why**: Person-first language is the single most important language principle in RG communication. It preserves dignity, reduces stigma, and increases the likelihood that the person will engage with support resources.

### Play / Player
**Preferred**: "Play," "player" (in player-facing contexts)
**Avoid**: "Gamble," "gambler" (in player-facing contexts)
**Context**: Use in player-facing content when referring to the activity and the person. Use "gambling" and "gambler" in clinical, regulatory, and professional contexts where precision matters.
**Why**: "Play" and "player" are less loaded terms that feel more natural in a wellness context. "Gambling" carries connotations that can feel clinical or stigmatizing in casual contexts.

### Positive play
**Preferred**: "Positive play," "playing within your limits," "healthy play habits"
**Avoid**: "Responsible gambling" (in player-facing contexts)
**Context**: Use when describing the behaviors and attitudes associated with low-risk gambling.
**Why**: "Positive play" frames good habits aspirationally. "Responsible gambling" implies that the alternative is irresponsible — which is stigmatizing.

---

## R

### Reality check
**Preferred**: "Reality check," "session reminder," "time check"
**Avoid**: "Mandatory notification," "interruption"
**Context**: Use when describing the pop-up or notification that informs a player how long they've been playing.
**Why**: "Reality check" is the established industry term. "Session reminder" is a good alternative that emphasizes the supportive function. Never frame it as an "interruption" — it's a tool the player has (or should have) control over.

### Recovery
**Preferred**: "Recovery," "moving forward," "healing"
**Avoid**: "Being cured," "beating the addiction"
**Context**: Use when describing the process of overcoming gambling harm.
**Why**: Recovery is a process, not a destination. Avoid language that implies a binary "cured/not cured" state or combat metaphors that frame the person as fighting against themselves.

### Recurrence
**Preferred**: "Recurrence," "return to gambling," "setback"
**Avoid**: "Relapse"
**Context**: Use when describing a return to harmful gambling behavior after a period of abstinence or controlled play.
**Why**: "Relapse" carries strong addiction-model connotations and can imply moral failure. "Recurrence" is clinical and non-judgmental. "Setback" acknowledges the difficulty without implying that progress has been erased.

### Responsible gambling
**Preferred**: "Responsible gambling" (acceptable in professional/industry contexts)
**Avoid**: Using "responsible gambling" as the primary player-facing framing
**Context**: In industry, regulatory, and professional contexts, "responsible gambling" is the standard term. In player-facing content, prefer alternatives like "playing within your limits," "informed play," or "positive play."
**Why**: "Responsible gambling" implies that the alternative is "irresponsible gambling," which stigmatizes players experiencing harm. It also shifts the burden of responsibility entirely onto the player, ignoring the operator's role in providing a safe environment.

## S

### Self-assessment
**Preferred**: "Self-assessment," "check-in," "habits check"
**Avoid**: "Screening tool," "diagnostic test," "gambling problem quiz"
**Context**: Use when describing interactive tools that help players evaluate their gambling behavior.
**Why**: "Self-assessment" emphasizes player agency. "Screening" and "diagnostic" sound clinical and may deter engagement. "Check-in" is the most casual and approachable option.

### Self-exclusion
**Preferred**: "Self-exclusion," "voluntary exclusion," "taking a break" (for lighter contexts)
**Avoid**: "Self-ban," "banning yourself," "being excluded," "blacklisting"
**Context**: Use when describing the formal process by which a player restricts their own access to gambling for a set period.
**Why**: "Self-exclusion" is the formal term and is appropriate in all contexts. In casual contexts, "taking a break" softens the framing. "Ban" and "blacklist" carry punitive connotations that may deter players from using this important tool.

### Session limit
**Preferred**: "Session limit," "time limit," "session reminder"
**Avoid**: "Session restriction," "time cap"
**Context**: Use when describing tools that help players manage how long they gamble.
**Why**: Consistent with the "limit" framing used for deposit and loss limits.

### Stigma
**Preferred**: Acknowledge stigma directly: "Stigma prevents many people from seeking help"
**Avoid**: Contributing to stigma through language choices
**Context**: Name stigma as a barrier when it's relevant. This normalizes the conversation about stigma itself.
**Why**: Research consistently shows that stigma is the primary barrier to help-seeking for gambling harm. Naming it explicitly helps reduce it.

---

## T

### Tools
**Preferred**: "Tools," "features," "resources"
**Avoid**: "Interventions," "measures," "controls" (in player-facing contexts)
**Context**: Use when referring to the suite of RG features available to players (limits, reminders, self-exclusion, self-assessment).
**Why**: "Tools" implies utility and empowerment — something you use by choice. "Interventions" and "controls" imply external action imposed on the player.

---

## W

### Wellbeing
**Preferred**: "Wellbeing," "wellness"
**Avoid**: "Mental health" (unless specifically discussing clinical mental health)
**Context**: Use when framing RG in the broader context of player health and quality of life.
**Why**: "Wellbeing" is broader and less clinical than "mental health." It encompasses financial, social, and emotional dimensions — all of which gambling can affect.
