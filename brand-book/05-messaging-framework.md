# Chapter 5: Messaging Framework

This chapter provides the complete messaging system for {{PROGRAM_NAME}} — the tagline system, calls to action, core messages, and interactive content briefs that populate every touchpoint. This is your copy reference when creating any Compass content.

---

## Message hierarchy

{{PROGRAM_NAME}} messaging operates on four levels, from broadest to most specific:

| Level | What it is | Where it appears | How often it changes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Level 1: Tagline system** | Interchangeable taglines organized by pillar | Advertising, hero banners, logo lockups, campaigns | Operators choose from the system; rarely change |
| **Level 2: Pillar-aligned messages** | One core message per pillar | Campaign themes, content sections, landing pages | Per campaign cycle |
| **Level 3: Contextual messages** | Specific to a touchpoint, audience, or action | Deposit screens, quiz intros, email subject lines, feature prompts | Per touchpoint update |
| **Level 4: Long-form content** | Educational, explanatory, or interactive | Blog posts, articles, video scripts, quiz content | As needed |

---

## Level 1: The tagline system

Compass uses a **tagline system** — not a single prescribed tagline. Operators choose from the options below, mix and match across campaigns and channels, or use the framework to write their own. The system is organized by the four brand pillars.

### Sharp — "Know your game"

| Tagline | Best context |
|---|---|
| "Know your game." | Universal — works everywhere |
| "The smarter you play, the more you enjoy." | Educational content, onboarding |
| "Every game has math. Here's yours." | Odds education, myth-busting |
| "Think you know the odds? Let's find out." | Quiz and interactive content |

### Choice — "Your call"

| Tagline | Best context |
|---|---|
| "Your play. Your way." | General awareness, tool promotion |
| "Your limits. Your call." | Deposit limits, session tools |
| "Play on your terms." | Universal — brand awareness |
| "Your game. Your rules." | Empowerment messaging |

### Open — "No BS"

| Tagline | Best context |
|---|---|
| "Here's how it actually works." | How-it-works content, odds explainers |
| "No fine print. Just facts." | Transparency messaging, T&C explainers |
| "The odds are public. Now you know them." | Odds education, game guides |
| "Straight talk. Real numbers." | Data-driven content |

### Social — "Worth sharing"

| Tagline | Best context |
|---|---|
| "Share the smart play." | Social media, shareable content |
| "Challenge your friends." | Quiz and interactive content |
| "The best players know the game." | Community, social proof |
| "How well do you really know the odds?" | Quiz hooks, social engagement |

### Using the tagline system

- **Choose 2–3 taglines** as your primary rotation for a campaign cycle
- **Mix pillars** — a campaign can use a Sharp tagline for educational content and a Choice tagline for tool promotion
- **Write your own** — the system is a starting point. As long as new taglines align with the pillar framework and Compass voice, they're on-brand
- **Never use "Gamble Responsibly"** as your tagline. It's the opposite of what Compass stands for.

## Level 2: Core pillar messages

Each pillar has a core message that expands the tagline into a full idea. These work as campaign headlines, content section intros, or landing page leads.

### Sharp

> "Think you know how slot machines work? Spoiler: the machine doesn't know you exist. Here's the actual math behind every spin."

Use for: Myth-busting headers, educational content intros, quiz prompts, game guides.

### Choice

> "Your limits. Your pace. Your call. Compass puts the tools in your hands and gets out of the way."

Use for: Tool promotion, deposit limit features, session awareness, bankroll planners.

### Open

> "The house edge on blackjack is 0.5%. On slots, it's 2–15%. On American roulette, it's 5.26%. Now you know."

Use for: Odds transparency, game comparisons, data-driven content, T&C explainers.

### Social

> "Share this with the friend who thinks they have a 'system.'"

Use for: Social media hooks, quiz share prompts, myth-busting virality, challenge content.

### Tools-as-features

> "Deposit limits take 10 seconds to set. It's like a seatbelt for your bankroll — you set it once and it works in the background."

Use for: Feature promotion across all tools — deposit limits, session reminders, activity dashboards.

### Help availability (Tier 2 crossover)

> "Need to talk? Free, confidential, 24/7. {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}"

Use for: Helpline display across all touchpoints. Always accessible from Tier 1 contexts, even though it's Tier 2 content. Light touch — present without being intrusive.

## Level 3: Contextual messages

### Entertainment literacy messages

*Goal: Help players understand how gambling actually works.*

| Intent | Sample copy | Touchpoint |
|---|---|---|
| How odds work | "Every game has a house edge — it's how casinos stay in business. Here's what it means for your play." | Educational content, game guides |
| RNG explained | "Each spin is independent. Your 'lucky machine' has no memory. Here's why that matters." | Myth-busting, slot guides |
| Sports betting math | "A -110 line means you bet $110 to win $100. The $10 difference? That's the sportsbook's cut." | Sports betting education |
| Promotional T&Cs | "That '200% match bonus' has a 30x wagering requirement. Here's what that actually means in real money." | Promotions education |
| Bankroll framing | "Think of your gambling budget like an entertainment budget. It's the cost of the experience, not an investment." | Financial literacy, onboarding |

## CTA library

### Feature CTAs

## Warning statement standards

Many jurisdictions mandate specific warning statements. Compass treats these as a design challenge, not a compliance burden.

### Principles for on-brand mandatory messaging

1. **Meet the requirement exactly** — don't paraphrase legally mandated language
2. **Add context around it** — place the required statement within a larger, on-brand content block
3. **Give it visual dignity** — required messages should be legible and well-designed, not shrunk to minimum size
4. **Pair with action** — follow a warning with a helpful CTA whenever possible

### Example: Mandatory helpline display

**Bare compliance** (what most operators do):
> "If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, call 1-800-522-4700."

**On-brand compliance** (the Compass way):
> Free, confidential support is available 24/7 — for any question about gambling.
> **Call 1-800-522-4700** | **Chat at ncpgambling.org/chat** | **Text 800522**

Both meet the regulatory requirement. The second version is more inviting, provides more options, and frames the helpline as "for any question" rather than only for people who already identify as having a problem.

### Jurisdiction-specific required statements

See the `jurisdictions/` directory for exact required messaging for each market.

## Interactive content briefs

Interactive content is where Compass delivers the most value. These are concept specs — the frameworks that content teams use to build quizzes, calculators, and gamified educational experiences.

### Quiz framework: Game IQ

**Concept**: A short (7–10 question) quiz that tests the player's knowledge of how games actually work. Covers odds, RNG, house edge, myths, and smart play habits.

**Format**: Multiple choice, one question per screen, instant feedback per answer.

**Sample questions**:
1. "A slot machine hasn't paid out in 3 hours. What are the odds on the next spin?" → Same as always. Machines don't have memory.
2. "What's the house edge on American roulette?" → 5.26%. Show comparison to other games.
3. "You've won 5 hands of blackjack in a row. What does that mean for hand 6?" → Nothing. Each hand is independent.

**End screen**: Score + personalized insight + share CTA. "You scored 8/10. You're sharper than most. Challenge a friend?"

**Pillar alignment**: Sharp + Social

### Calculator: Bankroll Planner

**Concept**: An interactive tool where players input their budget and preferred games, and the tool shows estimated play time based on house edge and average bet.

**Inputs**: Budget, game type, average bet size.
**Outputs**: Estimated play time, expected loss range, comparison to other games.

**Key message**: "This isn't about winning or losing — it's about knowing how far your budget goes."

**Pillar alignment**: Sharp + Choice

### Calculator: Odds Comparison

**Concept**: A visual comparison tool showing house edge across game types. Players select games and see side-by-side comparisons.

**Format**: Interactive chart or card-based comparison.

**Key message**: "Not all games are created equal. Here's how they stack up."

**Pillar alignment**: Sharp + Open

## Message testing

Before deploying new messaging at scale:

### The CMO test
Show it to a marketing professional. Would they be proud to put this alongside their commercial brand? If it reads like a compliance department wrote it, revise.

### The read-aloud test
Read the message aloud. Does it sound like something a friend would say? Or does it sound like a regulatory filing? If the latter, revise.

### The action clarity test
After reading the message, can the reader identify what to do next? If the CTA isn't obvious, strengthen it.

### The scroll test
Put the message in its intended context (a mobile screen, an email, a poster). Would you stop scrolling to read it? If not, the hook isn't strong enough.
