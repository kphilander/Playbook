# Chapter 5: Messaging Framework

This chapter provides the complete messaging system for {{PROGRAM_NAME}} — the taglines, calls to action, core messages, and content hierarchy that populate every touchpoint. Use this as your copy reference when creating any RG content.

---

## Message hierarchy

{{PROGRAM_NAME}} messaging operates on four levels, from broadest to most specific:

| Level | What it is | Where it appears | How often it changes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Level 1: Primary tagline** | One sentence that captures the entire brand | Advertising, hero banners, logo lockups | Rarely (annual review) |
| **Level 2: Secondary taglines** | 3-5 rotating messages that express different facets of the brand | Campaigns, social media, posters, digital banners | Occasionally (per campaign cycle) |
| **Level 3: Contextual messages** | Specific to a touchpoint, audience, or action | Deposit screens, self-assessment invites, email subject lines | Frequently (per touchpoint update) |
| **Level 4: Long-form content** | Educational, explanatory, or narrative copy | Blog posts, landing pages, brochures, FAQs | As needed |

### Level 1: Primary tagline

> **"Play with direction."**

This is the default {{PROGRAM_NAME}} tagline. It works because:
- "Play" frames gambling as entertainment, not a problem
- "Direction" evokes the compass metaphor — knowing where you are and where you're going
- It implies intentionality without preaching — having direction is a choice, not a rule
- It's short (3 words), memorable, and works across channels

**Usage**: The primary tagline appears alongside the logo, in advertising, on promotional materials, and as the default campaign line. It should always be set in the heading typeface.

**When to customize**: If your organization has an established tagline that serves this purpose, use it. The primary tagline should be unique to your brand. The secondary taglines (Level 2) work well as-is for most operators.

### Level 2: Secondary taglines

These rotate across campaigns, channels, and touchpoints to keep messaging fresh while staying on-brand:

| Tagline | Best context |
|---|---|
| "Know where you stand." | Self-assessment, activity summaries, financial tools |
| "Your game. Your limits. Your call." | Deposit limits, session reminders, empowerment messaging |
| "Checking in is a sign of strength." | Self-assessment, mental health awareness campaigns |
| "Fun has no finish line — set your pace." | Session reminders, cool-off prompts, general awareness |
| "Every player deserves a compass." | Brand awareness, equity campaigns, general positioning |

### Level 3: Contextual messages

See the [Core message architecture](#core-message-architecture) below for a complete library of contextual messages organized by intent.

### Level 4: Long-form content

Long-form content includes educational articles, how-gambling-works explainers, myth-busting features, and personal stories. These follow the voice guidelines in [Chapter 4](04-voice-and-tone.md) and typically appear on websites, in brochures, and in email campaigns. See the collateral templates in `collateral/` for specific formats.

## Core message architecture

This table maps **message intent** (what you want to communicate) to **sample copy** (how to say it). Use these as starting points — adapt the specific wording to your brand voice while preserving the intent.

### Awareness messages

*Goal: Help players understand that RG tools and information exist.*

| Intent | Sample copy | Touchpoint |
|---|---|---|
| RG program exists | "{{PROGRAM_NAME}} gives you tools to play on your own terms." | Website, onboarding, marketing |
| Tools are available | "Deposit limits, session reminders, self-assessment — all in your account settings." | Account settings, onboarding |
| Help is available | "Free, confidential support is available 24/7. Call {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}." | Footer, signage, all touchpoints |
| For everyone | "{{PROGRAM_NAME}} is for every player — not just players with problems." | Brand awareness campaigns |

### Empowerment messages

*Goal: Help players feel capable and in control.*

| Intent | Sample copy | Touchpoint |
|---|---|---|
| Player agency | "You decide how much, how often, and how long. Your play, your rules." | Onboarding, general awareness |
| Limit-setting | "Setting a limit before you play is one of the smartest things a player can do." | Deposit flow, limit prompts |
| Positive framing | "Playing within your limits isn't about what you can't do — it's about making sure you enjoy every session." | Educational content, FAQ |
| Control tools | "Take control of your experience. Set deposit limits, session reminders, and more." | Account settings, CTA banners |

### Normalization messages

*Goal: Make engagement with RG tools feel normal, not exceptional.*

| Intent | Sample copy | Touchpoint |
|---|---|---|
| Self-assessment | "Lots of people check in on their play. It takes 2 minutes." | Self-assessment prompt |
| Limits as normal | "Most experienced players set some kind of limit. It's part of playing smart." | Deposit limit prompt |
| Help-seeking | "Calling a helpline doesn't mean something is wrong. It means you want to talk it through." | Helpline messaging |
| Taking a break | "The best players know when to step away. Taking a break is always a winning move." | Session reminder, cool-off prompt |

### Education messages

*Goal: Help players understand how gambling works.*

| Intent | Sample copy | Touchpoint |
|---|---|---|
| Odds literacy | "Every game has a house edge — it's how casinos stay in business. Knowing the edge helps you set realistic expectations." | Educational content |
| Randomness | "Each spin, hand, or draw is independent. Previous results don't affect future outcomes." | Myth-busting content |
| Time awareness | "Time moves differently when you're playing. That's by design. Session reminders help you stay aware." | Reality check prompt |
| Financial framing | "Think of your gambling budget the same way you'd think about an entertainment budget — it's the cost of the experience, not an investment." | Financial tools, onboarding |

### Support messages

*Goal: Connect players to help resources.*

| Intent | Sample copy | Touchpoint |
|---|---|---|
| Helpline | "Free, confidential support — no judgment, no pressure. Call {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}} or chat at {{CHAT_URL}}." | Helpline display |
| Self-exclusion | "Need a longer break? You can pause your account for a period that works for you." | Self-exclusion entry point |
| Concerned others | "Worried about someone's gambling? You're not alone, and you don't have to figure this out by yourself." | Friends/family resources page |
| Post-limit reached | "You've reached your limit for this period. If you'd like to talk to someone, support is available right now." | Limit-reached notification |
| Crisis | "If gambling is causing you distress right now, please reach out. Free, confidential help: {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}." | Crisis touchpoints |

## Warning statement standards

Many jurisdictions mandate specific warning statements. These regulatory requirements are non-negotiable — but they can still feel on-brand. Here's how to make mandatory messaging work within the {{PROGRAM_NAME}} voice:

### Principles for on-brand mandatory messaging

1. **Meet the requirement exactly** — don't paraphrase legally mandated language
2. **Add context around it** — place the required statement within a larger, on-brand content block
3. **Give it visual dignity** — required messages should be legible and well-designed, not shrunk to the minimum allowable size
4. **Pair with action** — wherever possible, follow a warning with a helpful CTA

### Example: Mandatory helpline display

**Bare compliance** (what most operators do):
> "If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, call 1-800-522-4700."

**On-brand compliance** (the {{PROGRAM_NAME}} way):
> Free, confidential support is available 24/7 — for any question about gambling.
> **Call 1-800-522-4700** | **Chat at ncpgambling.org/chat** | **Text 800522**

Both meet the regulatory requirement. The second version is more inviting, provides more options, and frames the helpline as being "for any question" rather than only for people who already identify as having a problem.

### Jurisdiction-specific required statements

See the `jurisdictions/` directory for the exact required messaging for each market:
- `jurisdictions/united-kingdom/required-messaging.md`
- `jurisdictions/united-states/required-messaging.md`
- `jurisdictions/australia/required-messaging.md`
- `jurisdictions/canada/required-messaging.md`
- `jurisdictions/european-union/required-messaging.md`

## Message testing guidance

Before deploying new messaging at scale, test it:

### Quick comprehension test
Show the message to 5 people unfamiliar with gambling terminology. Ask them to explain what it means in their own words. If any of the 5 can't, simplify.

### Stigma check
Ask: "Would you feel uncomfortable if this message appeared on your screen while someone was looking over your shoulder?" If yes, revise — the message may inadvertently stigmatize.

### Action clarity test
After reading the message, can the person identify what they should do next? If the CTA isn't obvious, strengthen it.

### Tone check
Read the message aloud. Does it sound like something a trusted friend would say, or like something a compliance department would write? If the latter, revise.
