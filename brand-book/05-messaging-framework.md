# Chapter 5: Messaging Framework

This chapter provides the complete messaging system for {{PROGRAM_NAME}} — the tagline system, calls to action, core messages, and interactive content briefs that populate every touchpoint. This is your copy reference when creating any Playbook content.

---

## Message hierarchy

{{PROGRAM_NAME}} messaging operates on four levels, from broadest to most specific:

| Level | What it is | Where it appears | How often it changes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Level 1: Tagline system** | Interchangeable taglines organized by pillar | Advertising, hero banners, logo lockups, campaigns | Operators choose from the system; rarely change |
| **Level 2: Pillar-aligned messages** | One core message per pillar | Campaign themes, content sections, landing pages | Per campaign cycle |
| **Level 3: Contextual messages** | Specific to a touchpoint, audience, or action | Deposit screens, quiz intros, email subject lines, feature prompts | Per touchpoint update |
| **Level 4: Long-form content** | Educational, explanatory, or interactive | Blog posts, articles, video scripts, quiz content | As needed |

---

## Level 1: The tagline system

Playbook uses a **tagline system** — not a single prescribed tagline. Operators choose from the options below, mix and match across campaigns and channels, or use the framework to write their own. The system is organized by the two brand pillars.

### Open — "No fine print"

| Tagline | Best context |
|---|---|
| "Here's how it actually works." | How-it-works content, odds explainers |
| "No fine print. Just facts." | Transparency messaging, T&C explainers |
| "The odds are public. Now you know them." | Odds education, game guides |
| "Every game has math. Here's yours." | Odds education, myth-busting |
| "Straight talk. Real numbers." | Data-driven content |

### Social — "Worth sharing"

| Tagline | Best context |
|---|---|
| "Share the facts." | Social media, shareable content |
| "Challenge your friends." | Quiz and interactive content |
| "The best players know the game." | Community, social proof |
| "How well do you really know the odds?" | Quiz hooks, social engagement |

### Using the tagline system

- **Choose 2–3 taglines** as your primary rotation for a campaign cycle
- **Mix pillars** — a campaign can use an Open tagline for educational content and a Social tagline for quiz promotion
- **Write your own** — the system is a starting point. As long as new taglines align with the pillar framework and Playbook voice, they're on-brand
- **Never use "Gamble Responsibly"** as your tagline. It's the opposite of what Playbook stands for.

### Player segments overview

{{PROGRAM_NAME}} messaging is designed for six player segments. Each segment has distinct motivations, preferred channels, and content that resonates. The segment profiles inform how messages are adapted — not what the messages say.

| Segment | Who they are | What resonates | Primary channel | Deep dive |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| General players | Broad audience, casual to regular | Odds literacy, how-it-works, tools-as-features | Content hub, social | `messaging/player-segments/general-players.md` |
| Young adults (18-25) | Digital-native, social-first | Myth-busting, quiz challenges, shareable content | Social, in-app | `messaging/player-segments/young-adults.md` |
| Sports bettors | Skill-oriented, data-driven | Parlay math, vig education, bankroll planning | In-app, email | `messaging/player-segments/sports-bettors.md` |
| At-risk players | Showing behavioral indicators | Session awareness, limit tools, check-in prompts | In-app, personalized | `messaging/player-segments/at-risk-players.md` |
| Help seekers | Actively looking for support | Helpline access, self-exclusion, Tier 2 support | Support page, in-app | `messaging/player-segments/help-seekers.md` |
| Friends & family | Concerned about someone else | Conversation starters, support resources, what to say | Content hub, social | `messaging/player-segments/friends-and-family.md` |

Content creators don't need to write segment-specific copy for every touchpoint. The general voice and tone work for everyone. Use segment profiles when designing targeted campaigns or when content appears at segment-specific touchpoints (e.g., a parlay odds display targets sports bettors; a self-exclusion flow targets help seekers).

#### When to use segment-specific messaging

Most {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content works for all segments without modification. Apply segment-specific adaptation only when:

- **The touchpoint is segment-specific by nature.** A self-exclusion flow is inherently a help-seeker touchpoint. A parlay odds display is inherently a sports bettor touchpoint. The content at these touchpoints should reflect the segment's language and motivations.
- **A campaign deliberately targets one segment.** If you're running a social media campaign aimed at young adults, adapt the tone, format, and channel to match their profile.
- **Behavioral data identifies a segment.** If an in-app trigger fires because a player meets at-risk behavioral indicators, the resulting message should use the at-risk player profile — not the general player voice.
- **You're localizing for a channel.** The same core message might appear as a long-form article on the content hub (general players) and as a social card with a quiz hook on Instagram (young adults). The message stays the same; the format adapts.

#### What stays the same across segments

Regardless of segment, all {{PROGRAM_NAME}} messaging:

- Uses the same voice principles (clear, factual, never preachy)
- Follows the same tone spectrum defined in Chapter 4
- Draws from the same tagline system and CTA library
- Maintains the same information hierarchy (facts first, tools second, support always accessible)
- Never uses scare tactics, shame, or guilt — even for at-risk players and help seekers

#### Segment profile deep dives

Each segment profile document contains:

- **Demographics and psychographics** — who they are, what motivates them, how they engage with gambling content
- **Message adaptation examples** — how the same core message changes for the segment
- **Channel recommendations** — where to reach them and what formats work best
- **Tone calibration** — how to adjust within the tone spectrum for this segment
- **Do's and don'ts** — segment-specific pitfalls and best practices
- **Sample campaign brief** — a worked example showing a mini-campaign tailored to the segment

---

## Level 2: Core pillar messages

Each pillar has a core message that expands the tagline into a full idea. These work as campaign headlines, content section intros, or landing page leads.

### Open

> "The house edge on blackjack is 0.5%. On slots, it's 2–15%. On American roulette, it's 5.26%. Now you know."

Use for: Odds transparency, game comparisons, myth-busting, data-driven content, T&C explainers, how-it-works content, game guides.

### Social

> "Share this with the friend who thinks they have a 'system.'"

Use for: Social media hooks, quiz share prompts, myth-busting virality, challenge content.

### Tools-as-features

> "Deposit limits take 10 seconds to set. It's like a seatbelt for your bankroll — you set it once and it works in the background."

Use for: Feature promotion across all tools — deposit limits, session reminders, activity dashboards.

### Help availability (Tier 2 crossover)

> "Need to talk? Free, confidential, 24/7. {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}"

Use for: Helpline display across all touchpoints. Always accessible from Tier 1 contexts, even though it's Tier 2 content. Light touch — present without being intrusive.

## Level 3: Contextual messages

### Entertainment literacy messages

*Goal: Help players understand how gambling actually works.*

| Intent | Sample copy | Touchpoint |
|---|---|---|
| How odds work | "Every game has a house edge — it's how casinos stay in business. Here's what it means for your play." | Educational content, game guides |
| RNG explained | "Each spin is independent. Your 'lucky machine' has no memory. Here's why that matters." | Myth-busting, slot guides |
| Sports betting math | "A -110 line means you bet $110 to win $100. The $10 difference? That's the sportsbook's cut." | Sports betting education |
| Promotional T&Cs | "That '200% match bonus' has a 30x wagering requirement. Here's what that actually means in real money." | Promotions education |
| Bankroll framing | "Think of your gambling budget like an entertainment budget. It's the cost of the experience, not an investment." | Financial literacy, onboarding |

### Tool promotion messages

| Walking away | "Walking away while you're still enjoying yourself is a power move. Set a session reminder." | Session end, general awareness |

### Support accessibility messages

---

## CTA library

Calls to action organized by function. These are the buttons, links, and prompts that drive player action.

### Entertainment literacy CTAs

| CTA | Context |
|---|---|
| "Take the quiz" | Game IQ quiz, odds quiz, myth-busting quiz |
| "Test your game IQ" | Quiz promotion, social media, onboarding |
| "See the real odds" | Odds education, game comparisons |
| "Read the breakdown" | Long-form educational content |
| "Watch the explainer" | Video content |
| "See how it works" | Game mechanics, RNG, house edge |

### Feature CTAs

| CTA | Context |
|---|---|
| "Set your limits" | Deposit / loss / session limit setup |
| "Try the bankroll planner" | Bankroll management tool |
| "Check your stats" | Activity dashboard, play summary |
| "Set a session reminder" | Session timer activation |
| "See your activity" | Monthly / weekly activity summary |

### Content CTAs

| CTA | Context |
|---|---|
| "Share this" | Social sharing on quiz results, myth-busters, facts |
| "Challenge a friend" | Quiz sharing, competitive content |
| "Explore more" | Content hub, related articles |
| "Get the facts" | Myth-busting content, odds explainers |

### Support CTAs (Tier 2 crossover)

| CTA | Context |
|---|---|
| "Talk to someone — free and confidential" | Helpline access |
| "Call {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}" | Direct phone helpline |
| "Pause your account" | Self-exclusion entry point |
| "Find support" | Support resources page |

**Note**: In Tier 1 contexts, support CTAs are present but not prominent. They're always one tap away, never the primary action on the page.

## Warning statement standards

Many jurisdictions mandate specific warning statements. Playbook treats these as a design challenge, not a compliance burden.

### Principles for on-brand mandatory messaging

1. **Meet the requirement exactly** — don't paraphrase legally mandated language
2. **Add context around it** — place the required statement within a larger, on-brand content block
3. **Give it visual dignity** — required messages should be legible and well-designed, not shrunk to minimum size
4. **Pair with action** — follow a warning with a helpful CTA whenever possible

### Example: Mandatory helpline display

**Bare compliance** (what most operators do):
> "If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, call 1-800-522-4700."

**On-brand compliance** (the Playbook way):
> Free, confidential support is available 24/7 — for any question about gambling.
> **Call 1-800-522-4700** | **Chat at ncpgambling.org/chat** | **Text 800522**

Both meet the regulatory requirement. The second version is more inviting, provides more options, and frames the helpline as "for any question" rather than only for people who already identify as having a problem.

### Jurisdiction-specific required statements

See the `jurisdictions/` directory for exact required messaging for each market.

## Interactive content briefs

Interactive content is where Playbook delivers the most value. These are concept specs — the frameworks that content teams use to build quizzes, calculators, and gamified educational experiences.

### Quiz framework: Game IQ

**Concept**: A short (7–10 question) quiz that tests the player's knowledge of how games actually work. Covers odds, RNG, house edge, myths, and informed play habits.

**Format**: Multiple choice, one question per screen, instant feedback per answer.

**Sample questions**:
1. "A slot machine hasn't paid out in 3 hours. What are the odds on the next spin?" → Same as always. Machines don't have memory.
2. "What's the house edge on American roulette?" → 5.26%. Show comparison to other games.
3. "You've won 5 hands of blackjack in a row. What does that mean for hand 6?" → Nothing. Each hand is independent.

**End screen**: Score + personalized insight + share CTA. "You scored 8/10. You're sharper than most. Challenge a friend?"

**Pillar alignment**: Open + Social

### Calculator: Bankroll Planner

**Concept**: An interactive tool where players input their budget and preferred games, and the tool shows estimated play time based on house edge and average bet.

**Inputs**: Budget, game type, average bet size.
**Outputs**: Estimated play time, expected loss range, comparison to other games.

**Key message**: "This isn't about winning or losing — it's about knowing how far your budget goes."

**Pillar alignment**: Open

### Calculator: Odds Comparison

**Concept**: A visual comparison tool showing house edge across game types. Players select games and see side-by-side comparisons.

**Format**: Interactive chart or card-based comparison.

**Key message**: "Not all games are created equal. Here's how they stack up."

**Pillar alignment**: Open

### Campaign framework

{{PROGRAM_NAME}} ships with six ready-to-run myth-busting campaigns, each with a theme, schedule, channel specs, and pre-written copy.

| # | Campaign | Duration | Theme | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Slots Myths Week | 2 weeks | Debunking slot misconceptions | Casino operators, slots-heavy platforms |
| 2 | Beat the House? | 10 days | Table game truths | Casino operators, table game audiences |
| 3 | Sports Betting Reality Check | 2 weeks | Sports betting math | Sportsbooks, multi-vertical operators |
| 4 | Luck, Numbers & Lotteries | 1 week | Lottery and luck misconceptions | Lottery operators, casual gaming |
| 5 | The Money Myths | 10 days | Financial misconceptions | All operators |
| 6 | Game IQ Challenge | 1 week | Cross-game quiz challenge | All operators, engagement-focused |

Each campaign brief includes a day-by-day content calendar, channel-specific copy variants, and references to production templates. See `messaging/campaigns.md` for full briefs.

#### How to use the campaign framework

Campaigns are designed as plug-and-play modules. Operators can:

- **Run a campaign as-is.** Use the provided copy, schedule, and channel plan without modification. Swap in your operator name and branding, and launch.
- **Adapt a campaign to your market.** Adjust game references for your jurisdiction (e.g., replace slots-specific content with pokies terminology for Australian markets), swap out regulatory language, and localize helpline numbers.
- **Combine campaigns.** Run "Slots Myths Week" and "The Money Myths" back-to-back for a month-long awareness push. The campaigns are designed to complement each other without message overlap.
- **Extract individual assets.** Pull a single social card, quiz question, or article from any campaign and use it as standalone content. Every asset works independently.

#### Campaign scheduling guidelines

- **Avoid launching myth-busting campaigns during major sporting events or peak gambling periods.** Players are less receptive to educational content when they're focused on action. Schedule campaigns for shoulder periods.
- **Allow at least one week between campaigns** to prevent message fatigue. Players should not feel they are being lectured.
- **Align with cultural moments where relevant.** "The Money Myths" pairs well with financial literacy awareness periods. "Sports Betting Reality Check" works well at the start of a new sports season when new bettors are entering the market.

### Myth-busting library index

The myth-busting library contains 18 researched myths organized by game type, each with three content formats: social card copy, article explainer, and quiz question.

| Game type | Myths | Key topics |
|---|---|---|
| Slots & electronic gaming | 1-6 | Hot streaks, due wins, lucky machines, near misses, time of day, bet size |
| Table games | 7-10 | Betting systems, hot/cold dealers, card counting, number selection |
| Sports betting | 11-14 | Knowledge ≠ winning, parlay math, tipster myths, line shopping |
| Cross-game | 15-18 | Lucky numbers, sunk costs, house edge myths, bonus misconceptions |

See `messaging/myth-busting.md` for the full library with pre-written copy in all three formats.

#### Content format specifications

Each myth in the library includes three pre-written content formats:

- **Social card copy** (50–80 words). A punchy, shareable debunk designed for Instagram, X/Twitter, or in-app cards. Includes a hook, the myth stated plainly, the truth with a supporting number, and a CTA. Pair with the social card template from `collateral/templates/social-cards/`.
- **Article explainer** (300–500 words). A short-form article that explains the math behind the myth, provides context, and links to related tools or quizzes. Designed for the content hub, blog, or email newsletter. Pair with the article template from `collateral/templates/articles/`.
- **Quiz question** (single question, four answer options, instant feedback). Designed to slot into the Game IQ quiz or standalone myth-busting quizzes. Each question includes the correct answer, a brief explanation shown on answer reveal, and a "learn more" link to the corresponding article.

#### Using the myth-busting library

- **Start with the myths most relevant to your product.** A slots-heavy casino should prioritize myths 1–6. A sportsbook should start with myths 11–14. Multi-vertical operators can draw from all categories.
- **Rotate myths through your content calendar.** One myth per week is a sustainable cadence. A full rotation through all 18 myths takes approximately four and a half months.
- **Cross-reference with campaigns.** Each campaign references specific myths from the library. The "Slots Myths Week" campaign uses myths 1–6; "Beat the House?" uses myths 7–10; and so on.

### Quiz integration

Quizzes are the highest-performing engagement format in player education. The quiz framework defines structure, UI patterns, scoring, accessibility, and social sharing for interactive quiz content. See `collateral/interactive/quiz-framework.md` for the complete implementation guide.

#### Quiz types in {{PROGRAM_NAME}}

| Quiz type | Questions | Purpose | Where it appears |
|---|---|---|---|
| Game IQ | 7–10 | General knowledge across all game types | Content hub, social media, onboarding |
| Myth Buster | 5–7 | Focused on a single game category's myths | Campaign-specific, in-app |
| Odds Challenge | 5 | Quick-fire odds comparison questions | Social media, in-app prompts |
| Session Check-in | 3 | Lightweight awareness check during play | In-app, post-session |

#### Quiz content principles

- **Every question teaches something.** The answer reveal is the learning moment — not the question itself. Write answer explanations that are interesting enough to share.
- **Wrong answers are not punished.** Avoid language like "Wrong!" or "Incorrect." Use "Not quite — here's why" or "Good guess, but the math says otherwise."
- **Scores are framed positively.** Even low scores get encouraging language: "You're learning — that's the point. Share this with a friend and compare."
- **Social sharing is built into every quiz.** The end screen always includes a share CTA with a pre-written share message. Quiz results are the highest-performing organic social content in player education programs.

#### Accessibility requirements for quizzes

All quiz content must meet the accessibility standards defined in Chapter 6:

- Questions and answer options must be navigable by keyboard alone
- Answer feedback must be announced to screen readers immediately on selection
- Color is never the sole indicator of correct or incorrect answers — always pair with text and iconography
- Timer-based quizzes must offer an option to disable or extend the timer
- Social share images generated from quiz results must include alt text with the score and key takeaway

See `collateral/interactive/quiz-framework.md` for the full technical specification, including UI component patterns, scoring logic, analytics event definitions, and social sharing integration.

## Message testing

Before deploying new messaging at scale:

### The CMO test
Show it to a marketing professional. Would they be proud to put this alongside their commercial brand? If it reads like a compliance department wrote it, revise.

### The read-aloud test
Read the message aloud. Does it sound like something a friend would say? Or does it sound like a regulatory filing? If the latter, revise.

### The action clarity test
After reading the message, can the reader identify what to do next? If the CTA isn't obvious, strengthen it.

### The scroll test
Put the message in its intended context (a mobile screen, an email, a poster). Would you stop scrolling to read it? If not, the hook isn't strong enough.
