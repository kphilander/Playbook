# Chapter 7: Application Guidelines

This chapter defines how the {{PROGRAM_NAME}} brand system applies across different channels and media — digital, print, environmental, and video/audio. Each section establishes the rules for that medium and references the detailed collateral templates in the `collateral/` directory.

---

## General principles

These principles apply across all channels:

### 1. RG content gets equal design investment

If your promotional content has a professional design system and your RG content looks like an afterthought, players will treat it like one. Apply the same typography, color, spacing, and layout principles to RG content as you do to commercial content.

### 2. Helpline information is always one interaction away

On every screen, page, or surface — the player should be able to reach a helpline number or support resource within one tap, click, or glance. This doesn't mean it needs to dominate the layout, but it must always be present and accessible.

### 3. RG messaging is visible, not buried

RG content should appear in the primary navigation or settings hierarchy — not in a submenu behind three clicks. It should be present in the footer, in account settings, and at key decision points (deposits, wager placement, session milestones).

### 4. Consistency across channels

A player should recognize {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content whether they encounter it on a mobile app, a casino floor poster, or a TV ad. The visual identity (colors, typography, icons) and voice (tone, language) stay consistent — only the format adapts.

## Digital applications

### Website

**RG landing page**: Every operator site needs a dedicated responsible gambling page. This is the hub for all RG information: program overview, available tools, self-assessment, helpline resources, self-exclusion, and educational content.

| Element | Requirement |
|---|---|
| URL | Accessible from primary navigation (not buried in footer links) |
| Helpline | Prominently displayed above the fold |
| Self-assessment | Available directly from this page |
| Tools overview | Deposit limits, session reminders, cool-off, self-exclusion — all linked |
| Footer presence | A link to this page appears in the global footer on every page of the site |

**Footer strip**: A persistent footer element appears on every page containing, at minimum:
- {{PROGRAM_NAME}} logomark (or text identifier)
- Helpline number or link
- Age restriction notice
- Link to the RG landing page

**Templates**: See `collateral/digital/website/` for detailed page templates.

### Mobile app

Mobile is where most players gamble (60%+ of traffic). The mobile RG experience must be a first-class feature, not a scaled-down version of the desktop experience.

**Key touchpoints in the player journey**:

| Moment | What to show | Template |
|---|---|---|
| **Registration / onboarding** | Introduction to {{PROGRAM_NAME}} tools, optional limit-setting | `collateral/digital/mobile-app/onboarding-flow.md` |
| **First deposit** | Deposit limit prompt (optional but prominent) | `collateral/digital/mobile-app/deposit-limit-screens.md` |
| **During play** | Session timer / reality check (configurable frequency) | `collateral/digital/mobile-app/reality-check-modal.md` |
| **Account settings** | Full RG dashboard — limits, reminders, self-assessment, self-exclusion | `collateral/digital/mobile-app/account-settings.md` |
| **Limit reached** | Clear notification with support resources | `collateral/digital/mobile-app/push-notifications.md` |
| **Self-exclusion** | Multi-step flow with confirmation and support information | `collateral/digital/mobile-app/self-exclusion-flow.md` |

**Design principles for mobile**:
- Touch targets: 44x44px minimum for all interactive elements
- Thumb zone: Place primary CTAs within easy thumb reach on standard phone sizes
- One action per screen: Don't overload RG screens with multiple choices
- Persistent access: RG tools accessible from the hamburger menu or tab bar, not just settings

### Email

RG messaging should be woven into the transactional email lifecycle:

| Email type | RG integration | Template |
|---|---|---|
| Welcome series | Introduce {{PROGRAM_NAME}}, highlight available tools | `collateral/digital/email/welcome-series.md` |
| Deposit confirmation | Include current limits and link to adjust | `collateral/digital/email/deposit-confirmation.md` |
| Monthly activity statement | Spending summary with RG messaging | `collateral/digital/email/monthly-statement.md` |
| Cool-off confirmation | Confirm time-out, provide support resources | `collateral/digital/email/cool-off-confirmation.md` |
| Reactivation (post-exclusion) | Sensitive re-engagement with prominent RG tools | `collateral/digital/email/reactivation-email.md` |

**Email design rules**:
- Helpline number in every email footer (not just RG-specific emails)
- RG content should not be visually diminished (same font size, weight, and prominence as commercial content)
- Unsubscribe from marketing is required; never unsubscribe players from RG communications

### Social media

Social media is an opportunity to normalize RG conversations and build brand awareness.

| Platform | Content approach |
|---|---|
| **Instagram / TikTok** | Myth-busting reels, quick tips, infographic carousels |
| **X (Twitter)** | Quick facts, helpline promotion, campaign support |
| **Facebook** | Longer educational posts, community resources, event promotion |
| **YouTube** | Educational videos, player stories, how-it-works explainers |
| **LinkedIn** | Industry-facing: program achievements, research, thought leadership |

**Social media rules**:
- Every social profile bio includes the helpline number or link
- Never use gambling imagery (slots, cards, chips) in RG social content
- Engage thoughtfully with comments — refer people to support resources privately, not publicly
- Campaign calendar template: `collateral/digital/social-media/campaign-calendar.md`

## Print applications

Print materials serve land-based venues (casinos, betting shops, lottery retailers) and community outreach.

### Hierarchy of print collateral

| Format | Size | Purpose | Best placement |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Poster** | A2 / 18x24" | High-visibility awareness | Entrances, restrooms, break rooms, near ATMs |
| **Brochure (tri-fold)** | Letter / A4 | Detailed information and resources | Info centers, reception desks, health clinics |
| **Rack card** | 4x9" | Quick reference, portable | Card racks near exits, host desks, kiosks |
| **Table tent** | 4x6" | Point-of-play reminder | Gaming tables, restaurants, bars within venues |
| **Betting slip insert** | Varies | Helpline information on transaction records | Printed on or inserted with betting slips |
| **Business card** | Standard | Advisor or helpline contact card | Given by staff, available at info centers |

### Print design rules

- **Minimum logo height**: 0.25 inches (6.35mm)
- **Minimum body text**: 10pt (print is different from digital — 10pt in print is roughly equivalent to 14px on screen)
- **Helpline number**: Set in bold or a distinct typeface, minimum 14pt
- **Bleed**: Include 3mm bleed on all print-ready files
- **Paper stock**: Consider environmental sustainability — recycled stock, soy-based inks
- **QR codes**: Include QR codes linking to digital resources (self-assessment, helpline chat, program landing page). Test all QR codes before printing.

**Templates**: See `collateral/print/` for detailed specifications for each format.

## Environmental applications

Environmental branding covers the physical spaces where gambling takes place — casino floors, sports lounges, betting shops, and community venues.

### Venue signage placement

| Location | Format | Content priority |
|---|---|---|
| **Entrance / exit** | Wall-mounted sign or digital display | Program awareness + helpline |
| **Near ATMs / cashiers** | Small sign or poster | Deposit limits reminder + helpline |
| **Gaming floor** | Overhead or column-mounted | Session awareness ("How long have you been playing?") |
| **Restrooms** | Mirror cling or stall card | Private, discreet helpline access |
| **Break rooms (staff)** | Poster | Staff training reminders, how to refer players |
| **Info center** | Full branded environment | Comprehensive program resources |

### Environmental design principles

- **Visible from 3 meters**: Any public-facing signage must be readable from a reasonable distance. Use large type, high contrast, and minimal copy.
- **Dwell time matching**: Match content length to how long someone spends in that location. Restroom stall cards can have more copy than a corridor sign.
- **Privacy-sensitive placement**: Restroom and ATM-area signage should feel discreet — players should be able to note a helpline number without feeling observed.
- **Lighting considerations**: Signs near gaming floors may be in low-light environments. Use high-contrast combinations and consider illuminated or backlit options.
- **Multilingual**: In diverse communities, provide signage in the most common local languages.

### Info center design (GameSense model)

Some jurisdictions require or encourage dedicated on-site spaces for RG information. Based on the GameSense Info Center model:

| Element | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Branded counter or kiosk | Visible, inviting, staffed by trained advisors |
| Brochure display | Full range of print collateral |
| Digital screen | Rotating educational content, self-assessment access |
| Private conversation area | Space for confidential discussions |
| Take-away materials | Business cards, rack cards, helpline cards |

**Templates**: See `collateral/environmental/` for detailed specifications.

## Video and audio applications

### TV spots

| Format | Duration | Structure |
|---|---|---|
| Standard | 30 seconds | Hook (5s) → Message (15s) → CTA + helpline (10s) |
| Short | 15 seconds | Hook (3s) → Message (7s) → CTA + helpline (5s) |

**Creative direction**:
- Feature real, diverse people in everyday settings (aligned with photography guidelines)
- Avoid gambling environments in visuals
- Use a warm, conversational voiceover — not an announcer voice
- End with the helpline number displayed for at least 5 seconds
- In jurisdictions requiring "Gamble Responsibly" messaging, include it but give it equal visual weight to the rest of the spot

### Radio spots

| Format | Duration | Structure |
|---|---|---|
| Standard | 30 seconds | Scenario/hook (10s) → Message (12s) → CTA + helpline read twice (8s) |

**Audio rules**:
- Speak the helpline number clearly and repeat it
- Read the number at a pace that allows someone to write it down
- Use a friendly, natural voice — not a fast-paced commercial read
- Match the pace and warmth of the {{PROGRAM_NAME}} voice guidelines

### Digital pre-roll

15-second pre-roll ads for YouTube, streaming platforms, and in-app video:
- First 5 seconds must work without sound (text overlay with key message)
- Include helpline number as persistent text throughout
- CTA links directly to the RG landing page or self-assessment

### Phone hold messaging

When players call the operator's customer service line, hold music should include periodic RG messages:

- Keep messages under 15 seconds
- Rotate 3-4 different messages per hold cycle
- Always include the helpline number
- Tone: friendly, helpful, not alarming

**Templates**: See `collateral/video-audio/` for detailed scripts and specifications.

## Co-branding rules

When {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content appears alongside the operator's commercial brand:

### Visual hierarchy

| Rule | Rationale |
|---|---|
| {{PROGRAM_NAME}} logo is no smaller than 60% of the operator logo height | Prevents visual subordination |
| RG messaging uses the same or larger font size as surrounding commercial copy | Prevents the "fine print" effect |
| Helpline numbers are set in bold or a distinct weight | Ensures readability and quick scanning |
| RG content block has adequate white space / clear space | Prevents visual crowding |
| RG section has a clear visual boundary (divider line, background color, card) | Creates distinct "wellness space" |

### Tone boundaries

- Commercial content can be exciting, aspirational, and promotional
- {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content stays warm, grounded, and informational
- The transition between the two should feel natural, not jarring
- Never use promotional language in RG content ("Deposit $100, get a free tool check!")

### The adaptive identity in practice

Because {{PROGRAM_NAME}} is designed to be recognizable but adaptive:

- **Operators replace**: Colors, fonts, logo, program name, helpline numbers
- **Operators keep**: Layout patterns, information hierarchy, icon system, voice and tone, message structure, accessibility standards

This means a player who sets deposit limits on Platform A will recognize the same flow pattern on Platform B — even though the two platforms look completely different. The consistency is in the structure, not the skin.

## Responsive design

### Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Width | Primary context |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 768px | Phone, in-app experience |
| Tablet | 768px - 1024px | Tablet, small laptop |
| Desktop | > 1024px | Desktop browser |

### Responsive rules

- **Helpline strip**: Collapses from full text to icon + number on mobile
- **Navigation**: RG section appears in hamburger menu on mobile; in main nav on desktop
- **CTAs**: Stack vertically on mobile; display inline on desktop
- **Tables**: Convert to card layouts on mobile (stacked key-value pairs)
- **Posters / signage**: Digital signage content adapts to screen orientation (landscape vs. portrait)
