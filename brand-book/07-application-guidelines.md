# Chapter 7: Application Guidelines

This chapter defines how the {{PROGRAM_NAME}} brand system applies across channels and media — digital, print, environmental, and video/audio. The core principle: Playbook content should be **woven into the player experience**, not siloed into a separate "responsible gambling" section that nobody visits.

---

## The integration principle

The biggest mistake operators make with player education content is treating it as a bolt-on — a separate "RG page" buried in the footer, a compliance checkbox disconnected from the actual player experience.

Playbook takes the opposite approach: **integration over isolation**.

| Isolated (don't do this) | Integrated (do this) |
|---|---|
| A dedicated "Responsible Gambling" page linked from the footer | Playbook content woven into onboarding, account settings, game selection, and deposit flows |
| A helpline number in 8pt type at the bottom of the page | A helpline strip visible on every screen, properly designed and readable |
| A pop-up warning that players dismiss without reading | A session reminder that provides useful context (time played, spend so far) |
| A static brochure PDF available for download | Interactive quizzes, odds calculators, and shareable content in the content hub |

**The test**: If a player can use your platform for a full session without encountering any Playbook content unless they actively go looking for it, the integration has failed.

## General principles

### 1. Equal design investment

Playbook content gets the same design quality as commercial content. Same typography, same color system, same spacing, same layout principles. If the promotional banner looks like it was designed by a world-class agency and the player education section looks like a compliance afterthought, players will treat it accordingly.

### 2. One interaction to help

On every screen, page, or surface — a player should be able to reach a helpline number or support resource within one tap, click, or glance. Present, accessible, never intrusive.

### 3. Visible, not buried

Playbook content appears in primary navigation or settings — not in a submenu behind three clicks. Present in footers, account settings, and at key decision points (deposits, wager placement, session milestones).

### 4. Consistent across channels

A player should recognize Playbook content whether they see it on mobile, on a poster, or in a TV ad. Visual identity and voice stay consistent — only the format adapts.

## Digital applications

### Website

**Landing page**: Every operator site needs a Playbook content hub — a dedicated section for educational content, tools, quizzes, odds explainers, and support resources.

| Element | Requirement |
|---|---|
| URL | Accessible from primary navigation |
| Content hub | Educational articles, quizzes, odds tools, feature guides |
| Tools overview | Deposit limits, session reminders, activity dashboard — all linked |
| Helpline | Prominently displayed above the fold |
| Footer presence | Link in global footer on every page |

**Footer strip**: A persistent element on every page containing:
- {{PROGRAM_NAME}} logomark (or text identifier)
- Helpline number or link
- Age restriction notice
- Link to the content hub

### Mobile app

Mobile is where most players gamble (60%+ of traffic). The mobile experience must be a first-class feature.

**Key touchpoints**:

| Moment | What to show |
|---|---|
| **Registration / onboarding** | Introduction to tools, optional limit-setting, first quiz |
| **First deposit** | Deposit limit prompt (optional but prominent) |
| **During play** | Session awareness (configurable frequency) |
| **Account settings** | Full dashboard — limits, reminders, activity, quizzes |
| **Limit reached** | Clear notification with support resources |
| **Content hub** | Quizzes, articles, odds tools, myth-busters |

**Mobile design principles**:
- Touch targets: 44x44px minimum
- Primary CTAs within thumb zone
- One action per screen — don't overload
- Playbook tools accessible from hamburger menu or tab bar

### Email

Playbook messaging should be woven into the transactional email lifecycle:

| Email type | Playbook integration |
|---|---|
| Welcome series | Introduce Playbook, highlight tools, link to first quiz |
| Deposit confirmation | Include current limits and link to adjust |
| Monthly statement | Activity summary with Playbook messaging |
| Reactivation | Sensitive re-engagement with prominent Playbook tools |

**Email rules**:
- Helpline number in every email footer
- Playbook content uses the same font size and visual weight as commercial content
- Never unsubscribe players from Playbook communications

### Social media

Social media is where Playbook content earns organic reach through genuine engagement.

| Platform | Content approach |
|---|---|
| **Instagram / TikTok** | Myth-busting reels, quick tips, infographic carousels |
| **X (Twitter)** | Quick facts, quiz hooks, odds breakdowns |
| **Facebook** | Longer educational posts, community content |
| **YouTube** | Educational videos, how-it-works explainers |
| **LinkedIn** | Industry-facing: program achievements, thought leadership |

**Social media rules**:
- Every profile bio includes helpline or support link
- Content is designed to earn engagement, not just check a box
- Quiz results and myth-busters are the highest-performing formats — lead with them

## Print applications

Print serves land-based venues (casinos, betting shops, lottery retailers) and community outreach.

| Format | Size | Purpose | Best placement |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Poster** | A2 / 18x24" | High-visibility awareness | Entrances, restrooms, near ATMs |
| **Brochure** | Letter / A4 tri-fold | Detailed information | Info centers, reception desks |
| **Rack card** | 4x9" | Quick reference, portable | Card racks near exits, host desks |
| **Table tent** | 4x6" | Point-of-play reminder | Gaming tables, restaurants, bars |
| **Business card** | Standard | Helpline contact card | Given by staff, info centers |

**Print design rules**:
- Minimum logo height: 0.25 inches
- Minimum body text: 10pt
- Helpline numbers: minimum 14pt, bold
- QR codes linking to digital content hub — test before printing
- Design quality matches or exceeds commercial print materials

## Environmental applications

### Venue signage placement

| Location | Format | Content priority |
|---|---|---|
| **Entrance / exit** | Wall-mounted or digital display | Brand awareness + helpline |
| **Near ATMs / cashiers** | Small sign or poster | Budget reminder + helpline |
| **Gaming floor** | Overhead or column-mounted | Quiz QR codes, "Know your game" |
| **Restrooms** | Mirror cling or stall card | Discreet helpline access |
| **Break rooms (staff)** | Poster | Training reminders, player referral info |

**Design principles**:
- Readable from 3 meters for public signage
- Match content length to dwell time (restroom cards > corridor signs)
- Privacy-sensitive placement for helpline information
- Multilingual in diverse communities

---

## Video and audio applications

### TV spots

| Format | Duration | Structure |
|---|---|---|
| Standard | 30 seconds | Hook (5s) → Message (15s) → CTA + helpline (10s) |
| Short | 15 seconds | Hook (3s) → Message (7s) → CTA + helpline (5s) |

**Creative direction**: Feature real, diverse people enjoying themselves. Confident, energetic tone — not somber PSA energy. End with helpline displayed for at least 5 seconds.

### Radio and audio

- Speak helpline numbers clearly and repeat
- Use a natural, conversational voice — not announcer energy
- Match the warmth and confidence of the Playbook voice

### Digital pre-roll

15-second pre-roll for YouTube and streaming platforms:
- First 5 seconds work without sound (text overlay)
- Helpline number as persistent text
- CTA links to content hub or quiz

---

## Co-branding rules

When {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content appears alongside the operator's brand:

### Visual hierarchy

| Rule | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Playbook logo no smaller than 60% of operator logo height | Prevents visual subordination |
| Same or larger font size as surrounding commercial copy | Prevents the "fine print" effect |
| Helpline numbers in bold or distinct weight | Ensures readability |
| Adequate white space around Playbook content | Prevents visual crowding |

### The adaptive identity in practice

- **Operators replace**: Colors, fonts, logo, program name, helpline numbers
- **Operators keep**: Layout patterns, information hierarchy, icon system, voice and tone, message structure, accessibility standards

A player who sets deposit limits on Platform A will recognize the same flow pattern on Platform B — even though the two platforms look completely different. The consistency is in the structure, not the skin.

### Non-RG marketing pairing

Where jurisdictions require or operators desire Playbook messaging alongside commercial advertising:

- Playbook elements complement the promotion, not contradict it
- Helpline information is integrated, not tacked on as fine print
- The transition between commercial and Playbook messaging feels natural
- Playbook messaging uses the same production quality as the commercial content

**The goal**: A player seeing a promotional ad with Playbook messaging should think "this brand takes me seriously" — not "here's the legal disclaimer."

## Responsive design

### Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Width | Primary context |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 768px | Phone, in-app |
| Tablet | 768px – 1024px | Tablet, small laptop |
| Desktop | > 1024px | Desktop browser |

### Responsive rules

- **Helpline strip**: Collapses from full text to icon + number on mobile
- **Navigation**: Playbook section in hamburger menu on mobile; main nav on desktop
- **CTAs**: Stack vertically on mobile; inline on desktop
- **Tables**: Convert to card layouts on mobile
