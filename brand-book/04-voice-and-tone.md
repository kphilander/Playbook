# Chapter 4: Voice and Tone

This is the most critical chapter for responsible gambling content. The words we choose — and the words we avoid — directly affect whether players engage with RG resources or ignore them, and whether people experiencing gambling harm feel safe enough to seek help.

**Voice** is constant — it's who {{PROGRAM_NAME}} is in every context. **Tone** varies — it adapts to the situation, audience, and emotional context while staying true to the voice.

---

## Voice principles

These six principles are non-negotiable. They apply to every piece of {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content — from a push notification to a casino floor poster to a customer service script.

### 1. Person-first

We see the person, not the problem. We never define someone by their gambling behavior.

- We say "person with a gambling problem," not "problem gambler"
- We say "person experiencing gambling harm," not "gambling addict"
- We say "player," not "gambler" (when addressing the general audience)
- We talk about what people *experience*, not what they *are*

**Why it matters**: Person-first language is established best practice in health communication. It reduces stigma, preserves dignity, and makes people more likely to engage with resources. Research from NCPG and public health organizations consistently shows that label-avoidant language increases help-seeking behavior.

### 2. Empowering

We give information and tools. We don't give orders.

- We say "Set your limits," not "You should set limits"
- We say "You're in control," not "You must control yourself"
- We offer choices, not mandates
- We acknowledge the player's right to make their own decisions

**Why it matters**: Empowerment drives action. When people feel capable and autonomous, they're more likely to use tools and make positive changes. Paternalistic messaging ("You should stop") triggers resistance, not compliance.

### 3. Non-judgmental

We inform without shaming. We state facts without moral commentary.

- We say "Gambling can be harmful," not "Gambling is bad"
- We say "Many people experience problems," not "You might have a problem"
- We present self-assessment as self-care, not as suspicion
- We treat every player interaction with equal respect, whether they're setting a $50 limit or a $50,000 limit

**Why it matters**: Judgment is the enemy of engagement. A player who feels judged will close the page, leave the info center, or hang up the phone. Non-judgmental communication creates the psychological safety necessary for people to honestly evaluate their behavior.

### 4. Direct

We say what we mean. Clearly. Simply. Without jargon.

- We use short sentences (15-20 words average)
- We use common words over technical terms
- We write at a Grade 6-8 reading level (Flesch-Kincaid)
- We front-load the most important information
- We avoid hedging ("perhaps," "you might want to consider," "it could be beneficial to")

**Why it matters**: Clarity is accessibility. A player in distress needs to find help immediately — not parse a paragraph of qualifications. A player browsing casually needs to absorb the key point in a glance — not decode industry jargon.

### 5. Hopeful

We emphasize that help exists, change is possible, and positive outcomes happen.

- We say "Free support is available 24/7," not "Don't wait until it's too late"
- We say "People recover from gambling harm every day," not "Gambling addiction is devastating"
- We lead with the solution, not the problem
- We celebrate progress, not just milestones

**Why it matters**: Hope motivates action. Despair paralyzes it. Research consistently shows that positive framing is more effective than fear-based messaging in health communication. People who believe recovery is possible are significantly more likely to seek help.

### 6. Inclusive

We communicate in a way that works for everyone — across age, gender, culture, language ability, and gambling preference.

- We avoid gendered language (no "he/she" defaults — use "they" or "you")
- We avoid cultural assumptions (not all players are in casinos; many bet online or on sports)
- We write for people with varying literacy levels
- We design for screen readers, cognitive differences, and non-native speakers
- We avoid idioms that don't translate across cultures

**Why it matters**: Gambling harm affects people of every demographic. If our language inadvertently excludes someone, we've failed before we've started. Inclusive language ensures the widest possible reach.

## Tone spectrum

While the voice is constant, the tone adapts to four contexts. Each context has a specific emotional register.

### Informational

**Used for**: Educational content, how-it-works explanations, odds and probability information, FAQ answers, myth-busting.

**Tone**: Calm, clear, factual. Like a knowledgeable friend explaining something over coffee.

**Example**:
> "Slot machines use random number generators — every spin is independent. A machine that hasn't paid out in hours is no more likely to pay out on the next spin than one that just hit a jackpot. The odds are the same every time."

### Encouraging

**Used for**: Positive reinforcements, limit-setting prompts, self-assessment invitations, tool discovery.

**Tone**: Warm, supportive, motivating. Like a workout app congratulating you on a streak.

**Example**:
> "You've been playing within your limits for the past 30 days. That's something to feel good about. Want to explore more tools to stay in control?"

### Urgent

**Used for**: Self-exclusion flows, helpline referrals, limit-exceeded notifications, crisis support.

**Tone**: Direct, compassionate, action-oriented. Calm but clear about what to do next. Never panicked.

**Example**:
> "You've reached your weekly deposit limit. Your limit resets Monday. If you'd like to talk to someone, free confidential support is available right now: call {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}} or chat at {{CHAT_URL}}."

### Celebratory

**Used for**: Confirming positive actions, acknowledging milestones, post-self-assessment completion.

**Tone**: Affirming, warm, genuine. Not over the top — quiet pride, not fanfare.

**Example**:
> "Limit set. You've taken control of your weekly spending — that's a smart move. You can adjust this anytime in your settings."

## Language guide

### Words and phrases: Use / Don't use

This table is the operational core of the voice guidelines. Every person writing {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content should reference it.

| Context | Use | Don't use | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Describing someone with a gambling problem | "Person with a gambling problem" | "Problem gambler," "gambling addict," "compulsive gambler" | Person-first language preserves dignity |
| Describing gambling harm broadly | "Gambling harm," "gambling-related harm" | "Gambling addiction" (unless clinical context) | "Harm" is broader and less stigmatizing than "addiction" |
| Clinical diagnosis | "Gambling disorder" (DSM-5 term) | "Pathological gambling," "compulsive gambling" | "Gambling disorder" is the current clinical standard |
| Encouraging a break | "Take a break," "step away for a while" | "Stop gambling," "quit" | "Break" is temporary and non-judgmental; "stop" implies failure |
| Referring to treatment progress | "Recurrence" or "return to gambling" | "Relapse" | "Relapse" carries addiction stigma and implies moral failure |
| Referring to recovery | "Recovery," "healing," "moving forward" | "Beating the addiction," "winning the battle" | Avoid war/combat metaphors that imply a fight against oneself |
| Talking about player behavior | "Gambling behavior," "play patterns" | "Gambling habit," "gambling problem behavior" | Neutral, non-pathologizing language |
| Inviting self-assessment | "Check in on your play," "see where you stand" | "Find out if you have a problem" | Normalizing, not diagnostic |
| Describing limits | "Your limits," "limits you've set" | "Restrictions on your account" | Emphasize player ownership, not external control |
| Describing RG tools | "Tools to stay in control" | "Harm prevention measures," "consumer protection tools" | Player-centric framing over institutional framing |
| Describing self-exclusion | "Taking a break," "pausing your account" | "Banning yourself," "being excluded" | Self-exclusion should feel like an empowered choice |
| Referring to the gambling experience | "Play," "gaming experience" | "Gambling" (in player-facing educational contexts) | "Play" is less loaded; use "gambling" in clinical/regulatory contexts |
| Describing support services | "Support," "help," "resources" | "Treatment," "intervention" (unless clinical context) | "Support" is welcoming; "treatment" implies a diagnosed condition |
| The general audience | "Players" | "Gamblers" | "Players" is inclusive and non-stigmatizing |
| Financial language | "Spending," "budget," "limits" | "Losses," "money lost," "how much you've lost" | Focus on management, not deficit |
| Helpline introduction | "Free, confidential support" | "Crisis hotline," "addiction helpline" | Reduce perceived severity barrier to calling |
| Describing positive behavior | "Playing within your limits," "making informed choices" | "Gambling responsibly" | "Responsibly" implies the alternative is irresponsible |
| Urgency without panic | "Support is available right now" | "Don't wait until it's too late," "before it's too late" | Urgency without fear-based framing |
| Addressing concerned others | "Someone you care about" | "Loved one's gambling problem" | Non-presumptive about the nature of the concern |
| Describing the brand | "Wellness resource," "player resource" | "Harm minimization tool," "consumer protection" | Modern, inviting framing |

### Phrases to retire

These phrases are ubiquitous in the industry but actively harm engagement:

| Phrase | Problem | Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| "Gamble Responsibly" | Implies the player is currently being irresponsible. Treated as fine print. No actionable content. | "Play with direction." / "Know where you stand." |
| "When the fun stops, stop." | Assumes players can accurately self-diagnose the moment gambling stops being fun. Many players experiencing harm still report "fun." | "Set your limits before you play." |
| "Bet with your head, not over it." | Clever but unclear. What does "over it" mean in practice? Provides no path to action. | "Your game. Your limits. Your call." |
| "Must be 18+/21+ to gamble." | Necessary for compliance, but meaningless as standalone RG messaging. | Include the age disclaimer but accompany it with actionable RG content. |
| "If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, call 1-800-XXX-XXXX." | Only speaks to people who have already identified a problem. Excludes everyone else. | "Free, confidential support is available 24/7 — for any question about gambling. Call {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}." |

## Writing rules

### Reading level

Target **Grade 6-8** on the Flesch-Kincaid scale. This isn't about dumbing down — it's about maximizing comprehension for the widest possible audience. A player who has been gambling for 12 hours is cognitively different from a player who just opened the app. Write for the former.

### Sentence structure

- **Average sentence length**: 15-20 words
- **Maximum sentence length**: 30 words (anything longer, split it)
- **One idea per sentence** — don't stack clauses
- **Active voice** as default ("Set your limits" not "Limits can be set by you")
- **Passive voice is acceptable** when the actor is irrelevant or when active voice would be accusatory ("Your limit was reached" not "You reached your limit")

### Person and perspective

| Context | Perspective | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Player-facing content | Second person ("you") | "You can set your deposit limit in settings." |
| Organizational voice | First person plural ("we") | "We believe every player deserves access to tools and support." |
| Describing players generally | Third person ("players," "they") | "Players who set limits report more enjoyable experiences." |
| Crisis/support content | Second person, gentle | "You don't have to figure this out alone." |

### Formatting conventions

- **Bold** for emphasis on key terms or actions: "You can **set a deposit limit** at any time."
- *Italic* for introducing new concepts: "This is called *loss chasing* — continuing to play in an attempt to recover money."
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Use bullet lists for non-sequential options
- Use tables for comparing options or presenting structured information
- Never use ALL CAPS for emphasis — it reads as shouting. Use bold instead.
- Avoid exclamation points in serious contexts. Save them for genuinely celebratory moments (sparingly).

## The wellness tone model

To calibrate tone, consider how leading wellness brands communicate about sensitive health topics:

| Wellness app (anxiety) | {{PROGRAM_NAME}} (gambling) |
|---|---|
| "Everyone feels anxious sometimes. It's part of being human." | "Most people who gamble do so without problems. Checking in on your habits is part of playing smart." |
| "Try this 5-minute breathing exercise." | "Set a deposit limit — it takes 10 seconds." |
| "You've completed 7 days of mindfulness. Keep it up." | "You've been playing within your limits for 7 days. Nice work." |
| "Having a tough day? We're here." | "Need to talk? Free support is available 24/7." |

The pattern: **normalize → offer a tool → celebrate the action → always leave the door open for support**.
