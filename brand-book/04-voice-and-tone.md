# Chapter 4: Voice and Tone

This is the most important chapter in the brand book. The words you choose — and the words you avoid — determine whether players engage with your content or scroll past it. Get the voice right and everything else follows. Get it wrong and nothing else matters.

**Voice** is constant — it's who {{PROGRAM_NAME}} is in every context. **Tone** varies — it adapts to the situation while staying true to the voice.

---

## Voice principles

These six principles are non-negotiable. They apply to every piece of {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content — from a push notification to a casino floor poster to a social media post.

### 1. Informed, not alarming

"Here's how it works" beats "Here's what could go wrong" — every time. Playbook leads with knowledge, not warnings. The goal is to make players smarter, not more anxious.

- We say "The house edge on slots ranges from 2% to 15%"
- We don't say "The odds are stacked against you"
- We explain how games work as a matter of interest, not as a cautionary tale
- We treat information as empowering, not frightening

**Why it matters**: Fear-based messaging causes avoidance, not engagement. Players who feel anxious about gambling don't read more RG content — they stop reading entirely.

### 2. Your choice, your tools

We provide information and tools. You decide what to do with them. Playbook never tells players what to do — it tells them what's available and lets them choose.

- We say "Set your deposit limit" — not "You should set a deposit limit"
- We say "Your limits, your call" — not "You must limit your play"
- We offer features, not mandates
- We respect that adults can make their own decisions with good information

**Why it matters**: Autonomy drives action. When people feel in control, they're more likely to use tools. Paternalistic messaging triggers resistance.

### 3. Specific, not sloganeering

Playbook names concrete behaviors — knowing the odds, setting a budget, checking
your session time — instead of hiding behind generic labels like "responsible
gambling" or "smart play." Specificity is what makes content actionable.

- We say "Know the house edge before you sit down"
- We don't say "Be a responsible gambler" or "Play smart"
- We name the behavior: "Set a budget," "Check the odds," "Review your session"
- We frame tools as features that enhance the experience

**Why it matters**: Generic labels don't change behavior. Specific, concrete
actions do. "Set your deposit limit" is actionable. "Play responsibly" is not.

### 4. Fun is the point

Gambling is entertainment. Playbook exists to help keep it that way. The content should reflect that gambling is something people enjoy — and that understanding it better makes it more enjoyable, not less.

- We say "Know your game" — not "Know the risks"
- We acknowledge that gambling is fun, social, and exciting
- We don't treat gambling as an inherently dangerous activity that requires vigilance
- We position Playbook content as part of the entertainment, not a warning bolted onto it

**Why it matters**: If your RG content feels like it was written by someone who doesn't like gambling, players will tune out. Playbook is written by people who get it.

### 5. Real talk

No corporate hedging. No clinical jargon. No condescension. Playbook talks to players the way people actually talk — direct, clear, and conversational.

- We use short sentences (15–20 words average)
- We use common words, not technical terms
- We write at a Grade 6–8 reading level
- We front-load the most important information
- We skip the qualifiers ("perhaps," "you might want to consider," "it may be beneficial")

**Why it matters**: Clarity is accessibility. A player browsing casually needs to absorb the key point in a glance. A player under stress needs to find help immediately. Neither has time for jargon.

### 6. Inclusive by default

Playbook works for everyone — across age, gender, culture, language ability, and gambling preference. We don't assume anything about who's reading.

- We use "you" and "they," not gendered defaults
- We cover all verticals — online, land-based, sports, casino, lottery, poker, bingo
- We write for varying literacy levels
- We avoid idioms that don't translate across cultures

**Why it matters**: The gambling audience is diverse. Content that inadvertently excludes someone has already failed.

## Tone spectrum

The voice is constant. The tone adapts to four registers:

### Playful / Witty

**Used for**: Myth-busting, educational content, smart-play tips, social media, quizzes, general awareness campaigns.

**Tone**: Confident, self-aware, a little cheeky. Dollar Shave Club energy.

**Examples**:
> "Think you know how slot machines work? Spoiler: the machine doesn't know you exist. Here's the actual math behind every spin."

> "Your 'lucky machine' has the emotional range of a toaster. Here's what's actually happening inside."

> "Share this with the friend who thinks they have a 'system.'"

### Confident / Informative

**Used for**: How-it-works content, tool promotion, bankroll tips, odds explainers, feature announcements.

**Tone**: Self-assured, clear, authoritative. Like a smart friend explaining something useful.

**Examples**:
> "Set your deposit limit in 10 seconds. Your future self will thank you."

> "The house edge on blackjack is 0.5%. On American roulette, it's 5.26%. On slots, it's anywhere from 2% to 15%. Now you know."

> "Your bankroll planner is ready. Want to see how far your $200 can go this weekend?"

### Warm / Direct

**Used for**: Tier 2 crossover moments — when players reach for help, engage with support resources, or need a serious nudge. Humor drops away entirely. Warmth and clarity take over.

**Examples**:
> "Free, confidential support. No judgment. {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}"

> "You can pause your account for as long as you need. Here's how."

> "Need to talk? Support is available right now. 24/7."

### Celebratory

**Used for**: When players use tools, set limits, complete quizzes, or take positive actions. Not over the top — quiet confidence.

**Examples**:
> "You just set your first deposit limit. That's a power move."

> "9/10 on the odds quiz. You officially know more about slots than most players."

> "Deposit limit updated. Your money, your rules."

## Sample rewrites

The same message in "compliance voice" vs. "Playbook voice":

### Deposit limit prompt

**Compliance**: "In accordance with responsible gaming policies, players may elect to establish voluntary deposit restriction parameters via account settings."

**Playbook**: "Set your deposit limit. It takes 10 seconds. Go on, we'll wait."

### Helpline display

**Compliance**: "If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, call 1-800-522-4700."

**Playbook**: "Free, confidential support — for any question about gambling. Call 1-800-522-4700, text 800522, or chat at ncpgambling.org/chat."

### Session awareness

**Compliance**: "Pursuant to regulatory requirements, this notification is to inform you that you have been actively engaged in gambling for a period of 2 hours."

**Playbook**: "You've been playing for 2 hours. Most sessions average about 45 minutes. Set a session reminder?"

### Self-assessment

**Compliance**: "Are you concerned about your gambling behavior? Take a validated screening instrument to assess your risk level."

**Playbook**: "Curious about your play style? Take a 2-minute check-in. No judgment, just useful info."

### Limit reached

**Compliance**: "Your account has been restricted. You have reached your self-imposed deposit limit. This limit will reset at the beginning of the next billing cycle."

**Playbook**: "You've hit your weekly limit. It resets Monday. That's you playing on your own terms."

### Odds education

**Compliance**: "Players should be aware that gambling outcomes are determined by random number generation and that the mathematical expectation is negative over extended periods of play."

**Playbook**: "Every game has a house edge — it's how casinos work. Knowing the edge helps you pick your games and set your budget. Here are the real numbers."

## Language guide

These are the key language preferences for Tier 1 content. They're configured in `_brand.yml` under `tone > prefer` and `tone > avoid_in_tier_1`.

### Preferred language

| Use this | Instead of this | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Player** | Gambler | "Player" is inclusive and neutral. "Gambler" carries connotations. |
| **Specific behaviors** (e.g. "set a budget," "know the odds," "check your session") | Responsible gambling / Smart play | Generic labels don't drive action. Name the specific behavior you want the player to take. |
| **Tools / features** | Interventions / measures | "Tools" implies utility and choice. "Interventions" implies something done *to* you. |
| **Check in** | Self-assess | "Check in" is casual and inviting. "Self-assess" sounds clinical. |
| **Take a break** | Self-exclude (in Tier 1) | "Break" is temporary and voluntary. Use "self-exclusion" in Tier 2 and formal contexts. |
| **Your limits** | Restrictions | "Limits" implies ownership. "Restrictions" implies external control. |
| **Know your game** | Be aware of the risks | Information as empowerment, not warning. |
| **Entertainment budget** | Gambling money | Frames spending as planned, controlled allocation. |
| **Activity summary** | Loss report | "Activity" is neutral. "Loss" is deficit-focused. |
| **Session reminder** | Reality check | "Reminder" is helpful. "Reality check" implies you've lost touch with reality. |
| **Play patterns** | Gambling behavior | Neutral, non-pathologizing. |
| **Support** | Treatment / intervention (in Tier 1) | "Support" has a lower barrier. Use clinical terms in Tier 2. |
| **House edge** | Odds against you | Factual and educational, not alarming. |
| **Set your limits** | Limit your play | Agency framing vs. restriction framing. |
| **Pause your account** | Ban yourself | "Pause" is temporary and empowered. "Ban" is punitive. |

### Terms to avoid in Tier 1

These terms are appropriate in clinical, regulatory, and Tier 2 contexts. In Tier 1 (entertainment literacy), avoid them:

- "Responsible gambling" — use specific actions (e.g. "set a budget," "know the odds")
- "Smart play" — too generic; name the specific behavior instead
- "Problem gambler" — use "player" (Tier 1 doesn't diagnose)
- "Gambling addiction" — clinical term; Tier 2 only
- "Pathological" — outdated clinical term
- "Intervention" — use "feature" or "tool"
- "At-risk" — clinical category; not for player-facing content
- "Harm" — use specific benefits instead (Tier 1 is about what you gain, not what you avoid)
- "Disorder" — clinical diagnosis; Tier 2 only

### Phrases to retire

| Old phrase | Problem | Playbook alternative |
|---|---|---|
| "Gamble Responsibly" | Implies the player is being irresponsible. Nobody reads it. Zero actionable content. | "Know the odds." / "Set your budget." / "Check your session." |
| "When the fun stops, stop." | Assumes players can self-diagnose in the moment. Many players experiencing harm still report "fun." | "Set your limits before you play." |
| "Bet with your head, not over it." | Clever wordplay, unclear meaning. What does "over it" mean? No path to action. | "Every game has math. Here's yours." |
| "If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, call X." | Only reaches people who already identify a problem. Excludes everyone else. | "Free, confidential support — for any question about gambling. {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}" |

---

## Writing rules

### Sentence structure

- **Average sentence length**: 15–20 words
- **Maximum sentence length**: 30 words (anything longer, split it)
- **One idea per sentence** — don't stack clauses
- **Active voice** as default ("Set your limits" not "Limits can be set")
- **Passive voice is acceptable** when active voice would be accusatory ("Your limit was reached" vs. "You reached your limit")

### Person and perspective

| Context | Perspective | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Player-facing content | Second person ("you") | "You can set your deposit limit in settings." |
| Brand voice | First person plural ("we") | "We tell it straight. No BS." |
| Describing players | Third person ("players") | "Players who understand the odds enjoy the game more." |
| Support content (Tier 2) | Second person, warm | "You don't have to figure this out alone." |

### Formatting conventions

- **Bold** for emphasis on key terms or actions
- *Italic* for introducing concepts or referencing titles
- Numbered lists for sequential steps
- Bullet lists for non-sequential options
- Never use ALL CAPS for emphasis — it reads as shouting
- Exclamation points: sparingly, and only when genuinely celebratory

### The read-aloud test

Read every piece of Playbook content aloud. If it sounds like:
- A compliance department wrote it → rewrite
- A doctor is talking to a patient → rewrite
- A friend explaining something interesting → ship it
