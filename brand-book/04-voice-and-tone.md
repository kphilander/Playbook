# Chapter 4: Voice and Tone

This is the most important chapter in the brand book. The words you choose — and the words you avoid — determine whether players engage with your content or scroll past it. Get the voice right and everything else follows. Get it wrong and nothing else matters.

**Voice** is constant — it's who {{PROGRAM_NAME}} is in every context. **Tone** varies — it adapts to the situation while staying true to the voice.

---

## Voice principles

These six principles are non-negotiable. They apply to every piece of {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content — from a push notification to a casino floor poster to a social media post.

> **A note on cultural adaptation:** The six principles describe *what the voice achieves* — they are universal. They do not prescribe the exact register, humor level, or directness style used to achieve it. A market that adapts "Informed, not alarming" through an elder voice register and diplomatic directness is still honoring the principle — it's delivering knowledge without fear, just in a different dialect. See the [Cultural Adaptation Guide](../localization/cultural-adaptation-guide.md) for how expression varies across markets while these principles hold constant.

### 1. Informed, not alarming

"Here's how it works" beats "Here's what could go wrong" — every time. Playbook leads with knowledge, not warnings. The goal is to make players smarter, not more anxious.

- We say "The house edge on slots ranges from 2% to 15%"
- We don't say "The odds are stacked against you"
- We explain how games work as a matter of interest, not as a cautionary tale
- We treat information as empowering, not frightening

**Why it matters**: Fear-based messaging causes avoidance, not engagement. Players who feel anxious about gambling don't read more RG content — they stop reading entirely.

### 2. Your choice, your tools

We provide information and tools. You decide what to do with them. Playbook never tells players what to do — it tells them what's available and lets them choose.

- We say "Set your deposit limit" — not "You should set a deposit limit"
- We say "Your limits, your call" — not "You must limit your play"
- We offer features, not mandates
- We respect that adults can make their own decisions with good information

**Why it matters**: Autonomy drives action. When people feel in control, they're more likely to use tools. Paternalistic messaging triggers resistance.

### 3. Specific, not sloganeering

Playbook names concrete behaviors — knowing the odds, setting a budget, checking
your session time — instead of hiding behind generic labels like "responsible
gambling" or "smart play." Specificity is what makes content actionable.

- We say "Know the house edge before you sit down"
- We don't say "Be a responsible gambler" or "Play smart"
- We name the behavior: "Set a budget," "Check the odds," "Review your session"
- We frame tools as features that enhance the experience

**Why it matters**: Generic labels don't change behavior. Specific, concrete
actions do. "Set your deposit limit" is actionable. "Play responsibly" is not.

### 4. Fun is the point

Gambling is entertainment. Playbook exists to help keep it that way. The content should reflect that gambling is something people enjoy — and that understanding it better makes it more enjoyable, not less.

- We say "Know your game" — not "Know the risks"
- We acknowledge that gambling is fun, social, and exciting
- We don't treat gambling as an inherently dangerous activity that requires vigilance
- We position Playbook content as part of the entertainment, not a warning bolted onto it

**Why it matters**: If your RG content feels like it was written by someone who doesn't like gambling, players will tune out. Playbook is written by people who get it.

### 5. Real talk

No corporate hedging. No clinical jargon. No condescension. Playbook talks to players the way people actually talk — direct, clear, and conversational.

- We use short sentences (15–20 words average)
- We use common words, not technical terms
- We write at a Grade 6–8 reading level
- We front-load the most important information
- We skip the qualifiers ("perhaps," "you might want to consider," "it may be beneficial")

**Why it matters**: Clarity is accessibility. A player browsing casually needs to absorb the key point in a glance. A player under stress needs to find help immediately. Neither has time for jargon.

### 6. Inclusive by default

Playbook works for everyone — across age, gender, culture, language ability, and gambling preference. We don't assume anything about who's reading.

- We use "you" and "they," not gendered defaults
- We cover all verticals — online, land-based, sports, casino, lottery, poker, bingo
- We write for varying literacy levels
- We avoid idioms that don't translate across cultures

**Why it matters**: The gambling audience is diverse. Content that inadvertently excludes someone has already failed.

---

## Tone spectrum

The voice is constant. The tone adapts to four registers:

### Playful / Witty

**Used for**: Myth-busting, educational content, smart-play tips, social media, quizzes, general awareness campaigns.

**Tone**: Confident, self-aware, a little cheeky. Dollar Shave Club energy.

**Examples**:
> "Think you know how slot machines work? Spoiler: the machine doesn't know you exist. Here's the actual math behind every spin."

> "Your 'lucky machine' has the emotional range of a toaster. Here's what's actually happening inside."

> "Share this with the friend who thinks they have a 'system.'"

### Confident / Informative

**Used for**: How-it-works content, tool promotion, bankroll tips, odds explainers, feature announcements.

**Tone**: Self-assured, clear, authoritative. Like a smart friend explaining something useful.

**Examples**:
> "Set your deposit limit in 10 seconds. Your future self will thank you."

> "The house edge on blackjack is 0.5%. On American roulette, it's 5.26%. On slots, it's anywhere from 2% to 15%. Now you know."

> "Your bankroll planner is ready. Want to see how far your $200 can go this weekend?"

### Warm / Direct

**Used for**: Tier 2 crossover moments — when players reach for help, engage with support resources, or need a serious nudge. Humor drops away entirely. Warmth and clarity take over.

**Examples**:
> "Free, confidential support. No judgment. {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}"

> "You can pause your account for as long as you need. Here's how."

> "Need to talk? Support is available right now. 24/7."

### Celebratory

**Used for**: When players use tools, set limits, complete quizzes, or take positive actions. Not over the top — quiet confidence.

**Examples**:
> "You just set your first deposit limit. That's a power move."

> "9/10 on the odds quiz. You officially know more about slots than most players."

> "Deposit limit updated. Your money, your rules."

### Tier 1 vs. Tier 2 tone

The same brand voice powers both tiers, but the tone shifts significantly. This table captures the key dimensions:

| Dimension | Tier 1 | Tier 2 |
|---|---|---|
| Energy | Confident, energetic, witty | Calm, steady, warm |
| Humor | Appropriate — cheeky, self-aware | Never — empathy only |
| Sentence length | 15-20 words avg | 10-15 words avg (shorter under stress) |
| CTAs | "Take the quiz" / "See the odds" | "Call now" / "You're not alone" |
| Pronouns | "You" (empowerment) | "You" (connection) |
| Helpline framing | "For any question about gambling" | "Free, confidential, 24/7" |
| Metaphors | "Seatbelt for your bankroll" | None — literal language only |

The boundary between Tier 1 and Tier 2 is **tone**, not topic. A helpline number in a footer is Tier 1 (present, not prominent). A helpline number on a self-exclusion page is Tier 2 (warm, direct, and prominent). See `visual-identity/tier-2/tier-2-visual-guide.md` for the visual treatment.

**Tier 1 example** — helpline in a footer:

> "Questions about gambling? Free, confidential support: {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}"

**Tier 2 example** — helpline on a self-exclusion page:

> "You're not alone. Free, confidential support is available right now — 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Call {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}."

Notice that the information is identical — the same phone number, the same service. What changes is the emotional register: Tier 1 is matter-of-fact; Tier 2 is warm and direct. Both are honest. Neither is clinical.

When in doubt, ask: *Is the player browsing or reaching out?* Browsing is Tier 1. Reaching out is Tier 2.

#### Common mistakes at the tier boundary

Writers often misjudge the tier in these situations:

- **Session reminders** — Tier 1. The player is browsing. Keep the tone light and factual: "You've been playing for 2 hours. Most sessions average about 45 minutes."
- **Deposit limit confirmation** — Tier 1 (celebratory register). The player just took a positive action: "Deposit limit set. That's you playing on your terms."
- **Deposit limit reached** — Still Tier 1, but shift to the Confident / Informative register. The player is not in crisis; they planned for this: "You've hit your weekly limit. It resets Monday."
- **Self-exclusion landing page** — Tier 2. The player is reaching out for help. Drop all humor and metaphor: "You can pause your account for as long as you need. Here's how."
- **Post-self-exclusion check-in email** — Tier 2. The player is in a support context: "Just checking in. Your account is still paused. If you need anything, support is here for you."
- **Odds education article** — Tier 1. Pure information: "The house edge on blackjack is 0.5%. On American roulette, it's 5.26%."
- **Helpline number in a quiz result** — Tier 1. It's present but not prominent. Don't wrap it in warm language; just include it factually.
- **Helpline number on a "need support?" page** — Tier 2. Make it warm, direct, and prominent: "Free, confidential support — 24/7. Call {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}."

#### Writer's checklist for tier assignment

Before writing any piece of content, answer these four questions:

1. **What is the player doing right now?** Browsing, playing, searching for help, or recovering from a session?
2. **What emotional state are they likely in?** Curious, relaxed, stressed, anxious, or in crisis?
3. **What action do we want them to take?** Learn something, use a tool, contact support, or feel reassured?
4. **Would humor feel appropriate here?** If the answer is "maybe not," it is Tier 2.

If the player is browsing or playing and the goal is education or tool adoption, write in Tier 1. If the player is seeking help, experiencing distress, or engaging with support resources, write in Tier 2. When the answer is ambiguous, default to the warmer tone — it is always safe to be kind, never safe to be glib.

## Sample rewrites

The same message in "compliance voice" vs. "Playbook voice":

### Deposit limit prompt

**Compliance**: "In accordance with responsible gaming policies, players may elect to establish voluntary deposit restriction parameters via account settings."

**Playbook**: "Set your deposit limit. It takes 10 seconds. Go on, we'll wait."

### Helpline display

**Compliance**: "If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, call 1-800-522-4700."

**Playbook**: "Free, confidential support — for any question about gambling. Call 1-800-522-4700, text 800522, or chat at ncpgambling.org/chat."

### Session awareness

**Compliance**: "Pursuant to regulatory requirements, this notification is to inform you that you have been actively engaged in gambling for a period of 2 hours."

**Playbook**: "You've been playing for 2 hours. Most sessions average about 45 minutes. Set a session reminder?"

### Self-assessment

**Compliance**: "Are you concerned about your gambling behavior? Take a validated screening instrument to assess your risk level."

**Playbook**: "Curious about your play style? Take a 2-minute check-in. No judgment, just useful info."

### Limit reached

**Compliance**: "Your account has been restricted. You have reached your self-imposed deposit limit. This limit will reset at the beginning of the next billing cycle."

**Playbook**: "You've hit your weekly limit. It resets Monday. That's you playing on your own terms."

### Odds education

**Compliance**: "Players should be aware that gambling outcomes are determined by random number generation and that the mathematical expectation is negative over extended periods of play."

**Playbook**: "Every game has a house edge — it's how casinos work. Knowing the edge helps you pick your games and set your budget. Here are the real numbers."

## Language guide

These are the key language preferences for Tier 1 content. They're configured in `_brand.yml` under `tone > prefer` and `tone > avoid_in_tier_1`.

### Preferred language

| Use this | Instead of this | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Player** | Gambler | "Player" is inclusive and neutral. "Gambler" carries connotations. |
| **Specific behaviors** (e.g. "set a budget," "know the odds," "check your session") | Responsible gambling / Smart play | Generic labels don't drive action. Name the specific behavior you want the player to take. |
| **Tools / features** | Interventions / measures | "Tools" implies utility and choice. "Interventions" implies something done *to* you. |
| **Check in** | Self-assess | "Check in" is casual and inviting. "Self-assess" sounds clinical. |
| **Take a break** | Self-exclude (in Tier 1) | "Break" is temporary and voluntary. Use "self-exclusion" in Tier 2 and formal contexts. |
| **Your limits** | Restrictions | "Limits" implies ownership. "Restrictions" implies external control. |
| **Know your game** | Be aware of the risks | Information as empowerment, not warning. |
| **Entertainment budget** | Gambling money | Frames spending as planned, controlled allocation. |
| **Activity summary** | Loss report | "Activity" is neutral. "Loss" is deficit-focused. |
| **Session reminder** | Reality check | "Reminder" is helpful. "Reality check" implies you've lost touch with reality. |
| **Play patterns** | Gambling behavior | Neutral, non-pathologizing. |
| **Support** | Treatment / intervention (in Tier 1) | "Support" has a lower barrier. Use clinical terms in Tier 2. |
| **House edge** | Odds against you | Factual and educational, not alarming. |
| **Set your limits** | Limit your play | Agency framing vs. restriction framing. |
| **Pause your account** | Ban yourself | "Pause" is temporary and empowered. "Ban" is punitive. |

### Terms to avoid in Tier 1

These terms are appropriate in clinical, regulatory, and Tier 2 contexts. In Tier 1 (entertainment literacy), avoid them:

- "Responsible gambling" — use specific actions (e.g. "set a budget," "know the odds")
- "Smart play" — too generic; name the specific behavior instead
- "Problem gambler" — use "player" (Tier 1 doesn't diagnose)
- "Gambling addiction" — clinical term; Tier 2 only
- "Pathological" — outdated clinical term
- "Intervention" — use "feature" or "tool"
- "At-risk" — clinical category; not for player-facing content
- "Harm" — use specific benefits instead (Tier 1 is about what you gain, not what you avoid)
- "Disorder" — clinical diagnosis; Tier 2 only

### Phrases to retire

| Old phrase | Problem | Playbook alternative |
|---|---|---|
| "Gamble Responsibly" | Implies the player is being irresponsible. Nobody reads it. Zero actionable content. | "Know the odds." / "Set your budget." / "Check your session." |
| "When the fun stops, stop." | Assumes players can self-diagnose in the moment. Many players experiencing harm still report "fun." | "Set your limits before you play." |
| "Bet with your head, not over it." | Clever wordplay, unclear meaning. What does "over it" mean? No path to action. | "Every game has math. Here's yours." |
| "If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, call X." | Only reaches people who already identify a problem. Excludes everyone else. | "Free, confidential support — for any question about gambling. {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}" |

### Stigma-free quick reference

The following table captures the ten most common language swaps. These apply to all Tier 1 content — social posts, app copy, email, print, and in-venue signage.

| # | Don't write | Write instead |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Problem gambler | Player |
| 2 | Responsible gambling | Set a budget / Know the odds / Check your session |
| 3 | Gambler | Player |
| 4 | Gambling addiction | Difficulty with gambling (or describe, don't label) |
| 5 | Self-exclude | Take a break / Pause your account |
| 6 | Intervention | Feature / Tool |
| 7 | Reality check | Session reminder |
| 8 | You should | You can |
| 9 | WARNING | Heads up |
| 10 | Odds are against you | The house edge is [specific number] |

**Why these swaps matter**: Language shapes perception. When a player reads "problem gambler," they see a label — and labels push people away from engagement. When they read "player," they see themselves. The goal is not to avoid difficult topics; it is to discuss them without stigmatizing the audience.

A useful test: read the sentence aloud and ask whether a player who has never experienced difficulty with gambling would feel spoken to — and whether a player who *has* experienced difficulty would feel judged. If either answer is wrong, revise.

Note that these swaps apply to Tier 1 content. In Tier 2 (crisis and support contexts), some clinical terms are appropriate when used with care — a counselor-facing resource may use "gambling disorder" because precision matters in that context. The rule is: match the language to the audience and the setting, and always default to the less stigmatizing option when in doubt.

**Quick self-edit workflow**: After writing any piece of Tier 1 copy, search the text for each term in the "Don't write" column. If you find one, swap it. This takes less than a minute and catches the most common tone problems before review.

### Channel-specific tone shifts

The same core message adapts across channels. The information stays constant; the length, energy, and format shift to match what the player expects in each context.

**Core message**: "Deposit limits are available."

| Channel | Adapted copy |
|---|---|
| Push notification | "Your deposit limit tools are ready. Set yours in 10 seconds." |
| Email | "Did you know you can set a deposit limit in your account? It takes 10 seconds and works in the background — like a seatbelt for your bankroll." |
| Social media | "Deposit limits: 10 seconds to set, works in the background, adjustable anytime. Your bankroll, your rules." |
| In-app modal | "Set your deposit limit. Pick your amount, pick your timeframe, and play without second-guessing." |
| Help article | "A deposit limit is your entertainment budget, decided in advance. You pick the amount. You pick the timeframe." |

Notice the pattern: push notifications are the shortest and most direct. Emails have room for a metaphor. Social media uses rhythm and parallel structure. In-app modals focus on the immediate action. Help articles explain the concept plainly.

The voice stays the same across every row — informed, specific, player-first. Only the format and depth change.

Here is a second example using a Tier 2 message to show how channel adaptation works when the tone is warm and direct.

**Core message**: "Support is available."

| Channel | Adapted copy |
|---|---|
| Push notification | "Need to talk? Free, confidential support — 24/7. Call {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}." |
| Email | "If gambling isn't feeling like entertainment anymore, you're not alone. Free, confidential support is available anytime — day or night. Call {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}." |
| Social media | "Free. Confidential. 24/7. If you need to talk about gambling, call {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}." |
| In-app modal | "You don't have to figure this out alone. Free, confidential support: {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}." |
| Help article | "Support is free, confidential, and available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You can call {{HELPLINE_NUMBER}}, or chat online." |

Notice the difference from the Tier 1 example above. There are no metaphors, no cheeky asides, no playful rhythm. Every word is chosen for clarity and warmth. The sentence length is shorter. The CTA is immediate and unambiguous.

The two examples above — deposit limits (Tier 1) and support (Tier 2) — illustrate the full range. Most {{PROGRAM_NAME}} content falls somewhere between them. The key principle is that channel format changes but voice does not. A push notification and a help article should sound like they were written by the same person — just at different lengths.

When writing for a new channel, start by asking: *How much time does the player have?* A push notification gets 2-3 seconds. An email gets 10-15. A help article gets as long as the player needs. Let the available attention window determine the depth, not the importance of the message.

#### Adapting for character limits

Some channels impose strict limits. Here are practical guidelines:

- **Push notifications**: 50-80 characters ideal. Lead with the action or the offer, never with a preamble.
- **SMS**: 160 characters max. One message, one idea, one CTA.
- **Social media (organic)**: Platform-dependent, but front-load the first line — it may be all the player sees before "read more."
- **Subject lines**: 40-60 characters. Specificity wins over cleverness: "Your deposit limit tools" beats "Take control today."
- **In-app banners**: 1-2 short sentences. The player is mid-session; respect their attention.

When adapting across channels, always write the longest version first (typically email or help article), then cut down. It is easier to trim a complete thought than to expand a fragment. Each shorter version should preserve the core information and the CTA, even if it drops the supporting detail or metaphor.

If a message cannot be meaningfully condensed below a channel's character limit, split it into two messages or link to a longer resource rather than compressing the language into something unclear. Clarity always beats brevity.

For 40+ before/after pairs organized by tone problem (compliance, clinical, preachy, generic, alarming), see `messaging/tone-examples.md`.

## Writing rules

### Sentence structure

- **Average sentence length**: 15–20 words
- **Maximum sentence length**: 30 words (anything longer, split it)
- **One idea per sentence** — don't stack clauses
- **Active voice** as default ("Set your limits" not "Limits can be set")
- **Passive voice is acceptable** when active voice would be accusatory ("Your limit was reached" vs. "You reached your limit")

### Person and perspective

| Context | Perspective | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Player-facing content | Second person ("you") | "You can set your deposit limit in settings." |
| Brand voice | First person plural ("we") | "We tell it straight. No BS." |
| Describing players | Third person ("players") | "Players who understand the odds enjoy the game more." |
| Support content (Tier 2) | Second person, warm | "You don't have to figure this out alone." |

### Formatting conventions

- **Bold** for emphasis on key terms or actions
- *Italic* for introducing concepts or referencing titles
- Numbered lists for sequential steps
- Bullet lists for non-sequential options
- Never use ALL CAPS for emphasis — it reads as shouting
- Exclamation points: sparingly, and only when genuinely celebratory

### The read-aloud test

Read every piece of Playbook content aloud. If it sounds like:
- A compliance department wrote it → rewrite
- A doctor is talking to a patient → rewrite
- A friend explaining something interesting → ship it
