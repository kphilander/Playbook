# _taxonomy.yml — Playbook Content Taxonomy
# ============================================
# Defines all valid tag values for content frontmatter.
# This file is the single source of truth for the tagging system.
#
# This file is NOT operator-customizable (unlike _brand.yml).
# It defines the shared vocabulary across all Playbook deployments.
# Operators extend it by adding new values — they don't remove
# or rename existing ones.

# ─── CULTURAL PROFILE ───────────────────────
# Five plain-language spectrums for cultural adaptation.
# Operators pick one value per spectrum.
# See localization/cultural-adaptation-guide.md for detailed
# guidance on each value, with before/after examples.

cultural_profile:

  # Who's talking?
  voice:
    - peer             # An equal — someone at the table with you
    - authority        # A credentialed expert — institutional trust
    - elder            # A respected community figure — warm, earned trust

  # Who benefits?
  framing:
    - individual       # "Protect YOUR bankroll" — personal agency
    - communal         # "Protect what matters most" — family, community

  # What humor register?
  humor:
    - irreverent       # Bold, sarcastic, confident — current Playbook default
    - warm             # Inclusive, gentle, bonding — no targets, no edge
    - understated      # Dry, wry — implies rather than states
    - minimal          # Facts speak for themselves — little personality

  # How do you deliver hard truths?
  directness:
    - blunt            # "This bet is terrible. Here's why."
    - diplomatic       # "This bet carries a higher cost than most expect."
    - contextual       # Arrives at the conclusion through story or analogy

  # How openly is gambling discussed?
  comfort:
    - open             # Gambling is entertainment — talk freely
    - reserved         # Acknowledged but not celebrated — financial literacy framing
    - private          # Socially sensitive — never imply the reader is a gambler

# ─── PRESENTATION ───────────────────────────

# These are mechanical — they change examples and formatting,
# not voice or cultural framing.
