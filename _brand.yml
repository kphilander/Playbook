# _brand.yml — Playbook Brand Configuration
# ============================================
# This file drives the entire Playbook brand system.
# Fork this repo, edit this file, and your brand identity
# cascades across every touchpoint.
#
# Every {{PLACEHOLDER}} token in the documentation references
# a value here. Change it once. It updates everywhere.
#
# Quick start:
#   1. Replace "Playbook" with your program name
#   2. Replace "Your Company Name" with your operator name
#   3. Update colors to match your brand
#   4. Set your jurisdiction helpline numbers
#   5. Pick your taglines from the system below (or write your own)

# Every piece of content should align with at least one.

brand_pillars:

  - name: "Open"
    tagline: "No fine print"
    description: >
      Transparency about how things actually work. The house edge,
      the odds, the T&Cs, the stuff nobody reads. If it affects
      your play, we'll tell you straight.

  - name: "Social"
    tagline: "Worth sharing"
    description: >
      Content worth talking about. Quizzes, myth-busters, facts
      that make you the smartest person at the table. Share it.
      Challenge your friends. Start conversations.
